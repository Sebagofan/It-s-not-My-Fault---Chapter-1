# It-s-not-My-Fault---Author’s page:
Born in Boston as the fifth and last child in an Irish family in a predominately Irish-Italian neighborhood, I observed massive societal changes right in front of my eyes. 
Witnessing the end of the Cold War, the beginning of the Civil Rights movement, the start, and end of the Vietnam war leading to sex drugs and rock & roll revolution, and seeing first-hand assignations of key prominent leaders, our generation developed a more cynical view of the world and life overall.   
As I reached my teenage years, I was part of the beginning of the desegregation era in our public school system, which meant forced bussing in the early 70s. 
Our generation lived through a lot of turmoil and many families took sides, both pro and against the societal changes. America was at a crossroads! 
Having early symptoms of a Schizoaffective  disorder and not knowing how to deal with life while living symptoms with it, I turned to a process of self-medication. After extensive conflicts early on, I developed a hard outer shell for survival purposes where I felt a little more in control. 
As life progressed, I managed to not let life beat me down and benefitted by having an optimistic demeanor in spite of having deep depression which at times took total hold of me. I however always tried putting myself in the best possible position I could because of an inner desire to not settle for less. 
Having strong family influences both positive and negative became a blessing and a curse! My Dad used to say this about me, “Chris, you step in shit and come out smelling like a rose!” That could best sum up my life!


Chapter 1: The Early Days

Is it possible for a kid to go through a nervous breakdown at age 7? I actually think so, because I sense I did. There are some very personal things that I won’t discuss with you now, but know they had a profound effect on me which lasted a lifetime!	
2nd grade was a really tough year in my life!
Miss O’Leary known as one of the meanest teachers in our public school system just happened to find out that I was smoking cigarettes with some of the other guys. Consequently, she decided to hang me up on a coat hook like a slab of meat at a butcher’s shop for all my classmates to see.  
She kept me hanging there in the coat room for an hour or so to show everybody what happens to kids who disappoint her. Meanwhile, some of the other kids came into the coat room and began laughing at me which only made me lash out swinging and kicking wildly at them.  
That is not all, at the same time twice a week, I also had a CCD class with a second-grade catechism teacher who was named Sister Bennet. She was famous for dueling out a wicked punishment called the rat-tan. 
We considered this a medieval punishment that those nuns would use which amounted to them wailing on their knuckles with a wooden ruler causing extreme amounts of pain.  
She happily gave out this punishment way too often to misbehaving little Catholic boys like myself to keep us under her complete control. One day I tested her patients just one too many times!           
As a middle-class Boston Irish Catholic kid in second grade, I was expected to start Confession and receive Holy Communion that year. This did not go down as planned because of course I had to try sister Bennet and fool around in class. 
Much to my surprise, she was more than willing to meet out my punishment, “the rat-tan” on my knuckles as an example to everybody in the class as to how not to act. 
She grabbed my arm with one hand and swung that damn ruler on my knuckles with the other as hard as she could. The first whack fucking hurt! 
Well, the proverbial shit hit the fan! Before she swung twice, I jumped out of my seat, stood up, kicked her right in the shins, and made my escape out the front door. 
She did not bother to chase me because she was too busy rubbing her very sore shins. I eventually made my way home and much to my surprise, my parents had not even gotten a phone call from her. For some reason, Sister Bennet never bothered to call my home, lucky me, right? 
Weeks passed as I took it upon myself to hook Catechism class while hanging down Roslindale square,up on top of the roofs of all the businesses that occupied the square. I had a bird’s eye view of all the happenings in this pretty tough neighborhood. 
Cigarette smoking and hanging out with my brother and other buddies my age was of course what I did to kill the time I would ordinarily have spent in CCD class.  
Six weeks of doing this went by pretty quickly, when one day my father screamed at me from the living room for me to get my goddamn ass downstairs. 
He showed me the letter he received stating that because of my continued absence from CCD class, I would not be able to receive Holy Communion that year. 
Right then in there, he flipped out, chasing me out of the house trying to catch me to give me an ass kicking! 
Time went by that night and I got home to find my dad a little calmer, but that did not stop him from threatening me with eventual death if I ever hooked CCD class again. 
My dad and I now had to pay a visit with Sister Bennet and I was not looking forward to this scene whatsoever!
When we got there, the class had just started and Sister was in front of the whole class. She looked perturbed having to stop and take time from class to explain to my dad what happened, as he pleaded to Sister that if I didn’t get back into class his mom would kill the both of them! 
She shrieked, “There is nothing I can do about the situation,” he has missed too many classes and won’t be able to receive Holy Communion with his classmates!”  
Oh boy, you should have seen the look on dad’s face when all of a sudden, he just threw up his hands and yelled, “Fuck it, I don’t give a shit about the little bastard,” as he rushed out the door slamming it behind him leaving me standing there awkwardly in front of the completely stunned classroom full of petrified little second graders!
Sister Bennet at this point felt horrible about the scene dad caused and must have felt somewhat responsible because she hugged me seconds later and said, ”Poor boy, Poor boy, I’ll let you back in class and you can still receive Holy Communion with your classmates. Tell your father not to worry!” 
To this point in my life, this seemed to be a reoccurring theme of life events. I always found a way to get into trouble, but for some reason or another always managed somehow to get out of it. Either I had the luck of the Irish or had a very patient angel by my side!
A couple of months later, on the day of my Catechism ceremony, my friends and I broke into the O’Brien’s house with David O’Brien, who was their youngest son.  
His father used to lock him out of the house routinely because David could not be trusted alone in the house. True to form, we went in just to smoke the parliament cigarettes I had just lifted from my mother’s pocketbook. Mr. O’Brien came home unfortunately for me and caught us in the act. 
When I got home my dad must have received a phone call from Mr. O’Brien and he managed to find out about my misdeeds once again. He always had a weird eerie knack for always finding out the shit we got into. He must have had some type of inborn radar when it pertained to me and he always knew what I was up to. 
When I came in to get dressed for the Holy Communion Ceremony, he met me at the door with his belt in hand. 
My grandmother, who I never saw much of and did not even know that well, screamed at him to stop, saying, “Neil, you can’t punish him today, it’s his Holy Communion Day, a special day that should not be remembered for the punishment he got from his own father!”  
Dad looked at me and grumbled, “you lucky little bastard, today’s your lucky day!” Another magical moment in my life when I can look back and wonder, “How the hell did I get away with it again?”  
That fall I got into a lot of scrapes because of that personal thing that I won’t talk about and the older neighborhood kids thought they could intimidate me, but it always ended up with them yelling at me to calm the fuck down as I often scrapped with anyone who would fuck with me and I was often referred to as a crazy son-of-a-bitch! 
Street hockey and football were two sports where my brother and I excelled at and we kind of earned respect through our toughness, never backing down and always playing better than most guys our own age!
Life moved slowly and I dealt with Miss O’Leary and Sister Bennet and I somehow managed to escape into 3rd grade with my classmates. 
I went to confession reluctantly a few more times and did receive my Holy Communion with my class, but as far as CCD went, I knew I was never going back. That was kind of a done deal, the end of my Holy studies or at least until I was in high school at Catholic Memorial for a 2.5 year stint.  
Prior to these events were my dad’s insane behavioral acts which had a profound effect on my psyche. I wish I could blame it on the fact that he was a World War II veteran and in my life several times in the past I made up an excuse that my dad was a corpsman serving in battle with the marines, but this was a cover because the reality of it all was that he saw no action and I made excuses as to why he was so crazy. Why else would he act so insane, right?
Was it because one day when he came home from lunch, mom was on top of the outside of the sleeping bag which was zippered all the way up and had the milk-man was stuck inside it?      
According to her, she was trying to undo the zipper and free our milkman, Dick Boylan from the confines of an Alaskan sleeping bag that he wanted to borrow on a camping trip. Mom was just showing him how warm it was, or that was the excuse she used anyways!
He would pace the hallway unable to sleep at night, in a rage punching the wall and screaming randomly, even at Girt Nolan to go fuck herself, our saintly neighbor who was probably unaware of the verbal assault hurled her way for no particular reason.
Looking back at it now, I see the manic side of my dad way back then but unfortunately for me, things with him declined much worse, but coincidentally when I got older the fidelity mantra became a whole big thing for me too!
When I was about 25, right back from New York just a few years earlier with all the trauma I endured there. I began working track meets with my dad and there was a lady who worked there who had eyes on him and all I could imagine was him doing her too!
All of a sudden, I incoherently blurted out something to my father put him in a headlock, and ran him up six stairs, then pulled him down the same six stairs with him basically probably wondering what the fuck! 
The initial meds the VA had me on to help with paranoia only made shit way worse and I imagined dad cheating on my mom which infuriated me so fucking much!
Mom screamed Chrissy stop, what the hell are you doing? I released my 57-year-old shocked father and you could tell that I hurt his feelings. Whatever I was dreaming up in my mind wasn’t real whatsoever and after I accused him of cheating on mom with that lady, my mom burst out laughing! 
What a weird moment, mom deflated a potentially dangerous moment by explaining, dad would never cheat on her with that woman, she was too damn ugly, and that it was all in my head! 
Embarrassed as I was, I made a heartfelt apology to dad and he just hugged me and told me he loved me and that I’d be alright! 
He previously, however, had a lot of negative influences on me because of some of his insane, crazy antics he pulled in our house when I was 5 years old.
But years later inundated me with some deep devotion that he showered on a son; that in all probability, reminded him to be a bit of himself! Unfortunately, a lot of his early antics would inevitably scar me for most of my teenage and adult life. 
My mom and dad married each other back in the day when couples stayed married for life, as they had done. I realize now I think dad was bipolar, which would explain much of the way he sometimes acted, and not to forget to mention how all of us kids to some degree received his tendencies to be a little bipolar as well.  
I really remember a couple of incidents clearly even today when I was five years old that he did, which messed me up for many years. 
This one summer mostly with the windows all up to capture the summer breeze, my dad and mom had a lot of screaming matches in our home that echoed throughout this very close-knit neighborhood. It often escalated by dad throwing and breaking things, and his anger came out in a threatening controlling violence. 
Two nights in particular, I remember; dad went on a real tear and scared the shit out of us. One terrible night I vividly remember mom and dad fighting hard. I did not know why they were screaming at each other; I only knew it was especially intense that evening and I feared this would be a lot worse than usual.  
At first, I thought I would just be running downstairs to referee a loud screaming match but then ended up trying to wrestle a knife out of dad’s hand. He had taken a kitchen knife from the kitchen drawer and put it to his throat and screamed, “Fuck it, I’ll kill myself then!”  
I found myself in uncharted waters and it was either Timmy or Katie, along with my mother and I who began to wrestle the knife out of his hands. We still witnessed him cutting his throat deep enough to cause blood to spurt out all over the place. 
As we tried to prevent him from continuing in his efforts he knocked me to the floor, we all kept trying to disarm him, keeping him from doing any more damage!  
The sinking feeling in my heart from this was profound! At around five years old I was trying to figure out why the man I loved so much, who had a huge part in raising us, handled anger and grief by acting out in this way. I think this was his way of sowing deep fear in us all.   
Another night month’s later dad did about the same thing again, but this time taking a whole bottle of valiums and chasing them by downing a quart of whiskey as we tried in vain to intervene again, without any effect!  
What I now know, is that he used fear and intimidation as some type of method to control my mother. What I; until now did not realize was that to some degree I tried to emulate him later in life when I was in my own unhealthy relationships.  
Probably considered today as a form of “domestic abuse,” those events if repeated these days would make people today grimace at such behavior and how my mother managed, I’ll never know. 
That kind of behavior might even lead to police action with family court involving interventions with therapists, which may have been thrust upon us if this happened now. Which in actuality may have been helpful!
The horror of those nights haunted me long into the future. Little did I know his actions would have a profound effect on me many years later!  
The holidays always affected him the most for some reason. One time he took the decorated Christmas tree and threw it out the front door into the slushy winter snow, proclaiming he hated Christmas. 
I think it was the whole commercialization of Christmas instead of the celebration it was intended for, which was the birth of Jesus Christ!
At one point in his life, he considered becoming a priest. Wow, go figure!
Another night I remember, he took the Thanksgiving Day turkey and screamed, “there won’t be a fucking Thanksgiving,” then proceeded to throw the bird out in the backyard into the freshly fallen snow.  
My mom defiantly went outside and took the turkey into the house and cleaned it up and served it to the rest of us, while he stormed off upstairs to bed. Just another typical holiday at the Cronin house! 
I remember my dad one time getting into serious trouble at White Stadium where he worked as the Assistant Athletic Director in the Boston Public School System. 
One day during Special Olympics sporting event at White Stadium in July, he really got himself into a jam, that in retrospect I can look back and think to myself just how fucking crazy he really was!
This one summer day it sweltering 94 degree heat during a Special Olympics track meet. Because it was so hot my dad instructed the kids to go and sit under a shady oak tree where he provided paper cups and a 5-gallon cooler with iced water for the young special athletes. 
Well, you will never guess who attended the stadium that day. It was His Eminence, Humberto Sousa Medeiros, the Archbishop of Boston representing the Catholic Church with all its pomp and celebrity.  
The archbishop who I guess thought he was always in control took it upon himself to walk over and tell the kids to move out from underneath the tree so the ambulance could now park there to get out of the hot sun.  
Dad saw the kids now leaving from underneath the shady tree and back into the hot sun as the ambulance moved under the comfort of the shady tree. 
He immediately approached the driver and asked him to move again as His Eminence listened on just feet away. 
The archbishop fatefuly approached my dad scolding him loudly saying, “Mind your business, who do you think you are?” 
Oh boy, you would not believe what happened next?   
Dad screamed “Fuck you, asshole” and began punching the archbishop tackling him to the ground, all while his eminence was decked out wearing those full ceremonial robes including that weird strange black hat that they wore which made it look much more of a spectacle.  
Quickly the police escort who were supposed to be guarding his Eminence all converged on my dad; which in actuality, took all four officers to pry him off the now very shocked Holy Man. 
Dad got an unexpected invite in handcuffs down to precinct 13, a police station near the stadium where he knew most of the officers anyways. He sat in a dank private cell for a few days!
A couple of days later they escorted him to the VA mental ward and he stayed there for a month to treat his nutty behavior.  
I remember going to visit him at the VA hospital with Timmy and he gave me a wallet he made during an arts and crafts therapy session. Boy was he three sheets to the wind! They had him stoned on something, probably Thorazine. Wow, this was too surreal; dad was locked up because he was dangerous, go figure right!?
That summer apparently when dad recovered enough, we started camping all over when I was about six years old. I remember camping down at Cape Cod, and going to Vermont, New Hampshire, and all throughout Maine. Camping in the summer meant leaving the hustle and bustle of our beloved congested city of Boston.  
I had so many childhood memories camping all over New England. One time camping down in Cape Cod as dad was fishing in the canal. Timmy fell into the very strong Cape Cod Canal and the current swept him away. 
Michael who just became a lifeguard at the YMCA, jumped into the canal, swam after him despite the almost overbearing current, and rescued him from a probable drowning.  
So, I used to hang out with dad at White Stadium when I was about 7 in the summer. One particular day I went looking for him because Frank McCormick asked me to find dad and have him move his truck.
Well, when I approached his office, I heard behind closed doors some woman giggling in his office! This room conveniently had a bed-cot with the first aid cabinet in it where the nurse handily shared a room with my dad. 
When I knocked on the door, they all of a sudden became really quiet. Then I persisted in knocking loudly again this time yelling Dad I know you’re in there. Boy, what a pain in the ass that must have been!
Dad said, “Go away Chris I’m busy right now!” So, I just forgot my assignment and left, a little disturbed he was in there with the nurse giggling though!
Well, when I got home, I went right in and told my mom dad had me locked out of his office he and the nurse were in there giggling and he told me to leave because he was too busy!
Oh shit, did that start a fucking war! Mom had the fridge open as I told her this and she began whipping everything inside the fridge at him including cans, jars, and eggs. He was basically screwed! 
After the melee was over and in front of my dad. My mother told my dad he would be taking me to work every day that summer and that I was to keep an eye on him. Mind you I was only 7 years old.
The ride to work the next day was quiet, except for the part that day he called me a rat fink! But sorry, dad, (!) that’s my mom's buddy and I think he understood after all even back then although I adored him, I loved her too! 
Did I then pick up the lifelong trait of putting fidelity as being something extremely important, something I would obsess about to the extreme later in life to the point where it was debilitating? Maybe!
I can tell dad stories forever since he was a character like me. But there was one thing about my father that I can tell you now, he was extremely defensive when it came to his family!  
When I was at White Stadium that summer there was this incident where the sporting goods supply room at the stadium got broken into by some of dad’s workers. 
You see, at White Stadium, we held onto all the sporting equipment that would be delivered to all the Boston Public Schools! 
One day, there was this one worker who witnessed the break-in and he left a note on my dad’s desk ratting on the workers who broke into the storage room.
Dad I remember, played it cool and said he got a ride home from one of the suspects because coincidently that afternoon I lost his keys playing toss in the air with them as I threw it up in the air, I lost it in the sun and just went about my business forgetting I just lost dad’s keys!
Dad however, knew this guy had the stuff in his trunk and somehow got the guy to open it for him and busted him right there and then in front of me.
Well as pissed as he was, dad reported this one guy who was also a tenured teacher who we found out lost both jobs eventually once the superintendent of the schools found out about it. So needless to say, this guy was totally pissed! 
Here’s the thing. This guy thought I was the rat who finked on him and as dad and I were walking by him at lunch the day after, he threatened to slap the shit out of me!
Dad calmly walked over to him, then abruptly screamed “what mother fucker” and began hammering this piece of shit in the head with right hooks as he fell to the ground. Don’t ever threaten my son you bastard he screamed as he finished beating this guy.
The truth came out and the real rat was found out. It was this real skinny worker kid, whom they stripped naked and taped his hands and ankles together and left him there on the ground as dad and I got back into the stadium from lunch. Dad just handed me a knife and said “cut him loose!”

Another time I think around 1967 in New Hampshire, we went camping up in the White Mountains near Pinkham’s Notch. 
On this particular night; which happened to be my birthday on July 31, we were camping celebrating my birthday having cake and ice cream. Strangely enough, another family we noticed with a much bigger group were also having a birthday celebration just two campsites over from ours!
Their crowd was rather large as they surrounded a beautiful blazing campfire while they all sang happy birthday to the young boy who was around my age.   
It seemed to be getting late as I snuggled in a heavy woolen blanket on a cot with my family, as we were just finishing our celebration. 
There was an older woman over at the other party who grabbed some charcoal lighter fluid and began squirting it into the roaring fire, instantly making a loud boom as the lighter fluid hit the flame.  
What happened next, I’ll never forget! As she continued squeezing the lighter fluid can into the fire, the flames vaulted 12 feet into the air, but as she released her squeeze and the can began sucking the air back in, the flames which were now high as hell, followed the vapor trail back up into the can, exploding it instantly!  
I heard two booms that night. The first was when the fuel had initially hit the flames of the fire, which drew my attention; then a few seconds later was the second explosion as fire vaulted into the lighter fluid can following the vapor trail back to the can, exploding the 28 once container like a bomb! 
The explosion of the can completely left the elderly woman engulfed in fire! She immediately began running and I watched her viciously screaming in what I imagined was excruciating unimaginable pain.  
As she ran around the campsite now completely consumed by fire, trails of flames fell off her igniting the woods around the campsite as she ran. 
I’ll never forget how she resembled a human torch after the explosions, which were followed by the haunting extreme frantic screams which have stayed with me all these years later! 
Considering I was only eight years old when the event happened, it did not scare me all that much. My dad’s immediate reaction to seeing her running as a human torch was rather heroic though! 
He grabbed the blanket I had wrapped myself up in and charged toward the chaotic scene. As she was still both running around now completely enveloped by fire, the scene of him tackling the burning woman to the ground probably seared the memory into my brain for life!  
Right after he tackled her, he began rolling her in the blanket repeatedly rolling her over and over to extinguish her flames. She had third and fourth-degree burns on almost 80% of her body. 
The full-thickness of third-degree burns had spread throughout her whole body, extending to most of her upper torso and to all the layers of her face.  
Some fourth-degree burns additionally covered her neck and face involving a deeper injury to tissues including the face muscles, tendons, and even her eyes. Her hair and most of her clothes completely burnt off; filling the air with a disgusting burnt stench I can still recall all these years later!
The next morning was unnervingly silent, until my brother Neil told me the woman died as he started playing the Beatles song “Eleanor Rigby" written by Paul McCartney. 
It was one of the most surreal moments that early morning capsulizing the previous night’s events as I reflected on the horror, while now listening to the eeriness of the music and its equally disturbing lyrics. 
  
 "Eleanor Rigby"
Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 
 Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
 Lives in a dream
 Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
 Who is it for?
 
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?
 
 Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
 No one comes near
 Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
 What does he care?
 
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?
 
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 
 Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
 Nobody came
 Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
 No one was saved
 
 All the lonely people
 (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
 Where do they all belong? 

 
 
As I stared into the foggy meadows now surrounded by the mist and fog obscuring half of the mountain we were camped up next to, while listening to the song Eleanor Rigby, it left such an indelible image of the woman’s horrible death and subsequent sad burial that the song lyrics now depicted, as I imagined it being this poor woman who was now dead! 
Not to be outdone, I remember on another birthday morning, wakening early and walking down the stairs from my bedroom and to see a weird scene. There was so much fog outside, you couldn’t see more than 10 feet in front of you. Never ever had I seen it so foggy like that before. 
This would be the second horrific event on my birthday as a jetliner crashed at Logan Airport. It was a Delta Air Lines DC-9 twin-engine jetliner Flight 723, which was operating as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Burlington, Vermont to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. 
On July 31, 1973, at 11:08 AM, while on an instrument approach into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the glide path, struck a seawall with its landing gear, and crashed, killing all but two of its 89 occupants.  
Both survivors later died of their injuries as they were both burned terribly. 
Extreme heavy fog was reportedly the reason for the crash leaving all dead but the two survivors, as one died that night, while the other, Leopold Chouinard, eventually succumb to his burn injuries on December 11, 1973. Six months of hell!
Besides these two events, for me, however, a late July birthday was always wicked cool. Celebrating in July sure beat celebrating in January like my brother Timmy had to do.
Even going out to a restaurant with my parents became a little bit hazardous back then. As one night, I can remember with just mom, dad, and myself at a restaurant, dad began seething that he was going to fucking kill someone. 
Out of the blue, dad hauls back and whips a bud bottle and hits this guy right in the head, leaps up, runs over and grabs him off the seat and throws him on the floor, and begins punching this guy in the head. 
The waitress screamed, and we heard someone else say, call the police. So, dad got all of us and we left immediately without even paying. He was truly nuts!
Second grade rolled into third and fourth and so on. By the sixth grade, many neighborhood kids including myself were doing stupid things, like drinking on the weekends, and even progressed into us sniffing glue as I think I sought to forget my childhood completely! 
During this period of time, we had rock fights and unfortunately for me, I got hit in the right eye and had a detached retina as a result.
Recently asked by a loved one, why we did those stupid things like drinking and drugs and I could only reply by saying, “I thought it was a combination of us trying to escape reality, possibly having alcoholic tendencies, and probable for me unknowingly doing a lot of self-medicating.”   
Years later, my diagnosis and subsequent advancing symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia materialized and became part of how my life which drastically changed with this onset, led to uncontrollable bouts of paranoia leading to me accusing girlfriends of infidelity in relationships while irrationally and constantly looking for evidence of this truth.  
A lot more regarding this truth had owned me for years and is discussed in detail later on. But first, look at the events that led up to this time, as my life by no means was a normal one.
During the early days in Sebago Lake State Park which were, however the most memorable in my youth, we continued enjoying the lake and having fun. 
My parents actually liked the area so much from camping up there, that they bought land in Naples, Maine which bordered Sebago Lake around 1968. 
My dad first bought two, 100’X 50’ lots and we started bringing our new tent trailer up there camping and spending most of the summers in Naples.  
The land’s location was atop a huge hill in the foothills of the White Mountains, which were some twenty miles away from New Hampshire. This development sold lots for camping use and we bought four more lots together now enabling us to put a septic tank in for a mobile home they eventually bought.  
I remember dad; with our help, cleared the land by making huge bonfires and burning the brush. The fire’s smoke that came from the burning pine branches brought the attention of fire marshals, tipped off by a fire spotter stationed all the way over in New Hampshire in the White Mountains. 
Dad loved his Naples getaway and he eventually bought 12 lots in total over a space of eight years. The three youngest kids in our family, Katie, Timmy, and I got the most out of our Maine campsite. 
Dad and I started bonding back in those days and I remember the time dad and I would take the Old Town canoe down at Muddy River and he’d take me fishing. 
This one day, we got up early and got in our canoe and we caught several large trout. Dad said he’d show me how to clean and cook the fish and we’d have them for breakfast. Yah, like fish and eggs for breakfast, cool!
One time this huge fish dad caught finally got in the boat and it was truly impressive! By now dad and I had caught three, and he was going to have a fish fry again. But all of a sudden, that big fish began to flip and flop, and jump and dad instinctively took off his moccasin and smacked this fish. Knocked it out cold! 
Well, we began heading to shore and the damn fish gave it one more herculean effort and flung itself right over the boat and swam away victoriously leaving us in its wake!
We were city kids at heart but would now morph more into half-country kids, half-city kids, with both influences changing our life perspectives. 
From the ages between eight and all the way up until I turned closer to eleven years old, we somewhat behaved ourselves with relatively no issues. 
As we got older however while this area eventually developed bringing more families where we eventually would make more friends, some of whom we would raise hell with way too often in the future. 
We met friends who were from Lewiston Maine called the Terrians. Bert and Ricky Terrian were wild Mainers who we got along with and hung out with for years.
I remember being with Ricky who thought it was a good idea to hotwire this rowboat and I had a canoe with an engine in it, not mine by the way, just borrowed kind of illegally you could say. 
He basically dared me to play chicken with him with it on Muddy River as nighttime closed in and we both throttled out machines full bore of course my canoe was up in the air because nobody was in the front of it, so it just overrode the other boat and they both just kind of turned in circles all hung up on themselves. 
This brings me to another time when Timmy’s friends, Jimmy Cameron and Mikey Burke came up to Maine. Some of Tim’s Boston buddies and we all got into our 18’ Old Town canoe, filled with four cases of beer and invited four girls to come hang out with us at Sandy Beach, about a mile or so paddle. 
As soon as we went through the bridge and came into big Sebago Lake the waves of the lake capsized the canoe. 
Do you think we immediately rescued the 2 girls who couldn’t swim? NO! Instead, we just began diving for the cases of beer and the poor girls were all hanging onto the half-sunken canoe for dear life! Not our proudest moment mind you!
By thirteen I was a weekend warrior, drinking beer, smoking pot, and sometimes both. On the weekends we came up from Boston and always ended up partying at different various places that we named Big Beach and Little Beach, nicknames everyone around our area called the two beaches off Muddy River which was Sebago Lake’s main tributary. 
We eventually made a secluded spot behind an old farm and named it Smokies Den. Campfires were always part of our experience and we were always careful not to light the woods on fire.   
On a hot summer day when I was around fifteen years old, I was hanging with Rusty Lashua, a childhood friend who had a camp at the end of our road. 
We climbed up in this 150-year-old tree which had a 6’ wide circumference on it, lit up a joint, and began smoking it. The year before we built a tire swing using a 3” thick rope and an old trailer tire which was really high up in the air.  
So, this one day as we were still up in the tree smoking this joint, Timmy approached us from our lot above. I put up one finger up to my mouth and whistled shhhh, which meant for Rusty to shut the fuck up!  
As Timmy approached us, I remember him humming something somewhat loudly. We did all we could do to keep from laughing aloud. 
Timmy got into the tire swing and started pushing off the old pine tree trunk. As he got up momentum, the humming continued to get louder as his speed and trajectory increased. 
I so happened to be carrying a jack-knife on me and I motioned to Rusty to again stop snickering.  
As Timmy swung freely back and forth, I was busy sawing the 3” thick rope. Almost as if Timmy were a cartoon figure humming and swinging like a madman, I managed to cut the final threads of the 3” rope just as Timmy reached the highest trajectory of his swing. 
It sounded rather like this, “Lalala, nanana, ladiladi-La Nanana, Ahhhhhh oh-Fuckkkkk!” as Timmy flew into the air for three seconds, landing with himself still inside the tire, now rolling down the steep hill and bouncing off the remains of this 200-year-old rock wall which eventually stopped him some 60’ away from where the tire swing used to hang.  
He got out of the tire dropping many f-bombs when he heard Rusty and I laughing hysterically in the tree above. As my father used to say, “The shit hit the fan!”  
Timmy got to his feet and began screaming he was going to fucking kill me! While initially hysterically laughing, I started climbing up the tree instinctually, not giving it much thought until a huge fist-sized rock bounced off the branch directly above me, hitting right above my head and ripping a huge chunk of bark off the tree.  
We began climbing as fast as we could, as the rocks he was throwing whizzed by us several times a second. He screamed, “You stupid mother fucker, I hurt my damn arm, I’m going to fucking kill you, you stupid fuckhead!” 
This tree was huge and the top of the tree must have been 250’ tall, once we both reached it, the White Mountains and Mount Washington were all in sight. We did reach the top very quickly, which was partly the reason I escaped being smacked by flying rocks. 
He continued screaming at me, promising my eventual ass-kicking would come very soon. When I saw my parents pulling into the driveway in their old Volvo station wagon, I knew I needed my dad to rescue me before crazy Timmy’s rocks found their target. 
I immediately began screaming to my dad, “Help, help, dad help, this crazy bastard is trying to kill us!” Dad came right down and came up to Timmy who was still hurling big stones at us. 
Dad grabbed Timmy and wrestled with him briefly and asked Timmy what was going on as he now very excitedly screamed to him what we did.  
Dad begged Tim to calm down, which he immediately did, once dad had a hold of him, preventing him from hurling any more rocks in my direction. 
Dad saved me again, a reoccurring theme he would later repeat many more times in my life. 
Another time after a night of partying at Big Beach, the bigger of the two beaches on Muddy River we hung out at, Jim O’Connor and I walked back up to the camp now a little buzzed from drinking beers. 
About Five minutes after we reached the upper lot at my parent’s place, Timmy arrived and began climbing the trail to the upper lot.  
The trail was over 200’ long and at the top, my father used some of the old 200-year-old rock walls which he rebuilt as a retention wall to keep the gravel he dumped to level the top of the lot and cover up the septic tank he had installed from eroding away, which also formed an area where we had a huge campfire sitting area at. 
Next to the wall were other random boulders lining a walkway, some too big to move, but others I thought quickly to myself might be able to be rolled! 
As Timmy approached the road below which led to the beginning of the trail, I saw a boulder that I thought I could roll. It was a massive boulder, probably weighing close to 400 pounds or more.  
Given the fact that it was fairly round, I therefore imagined I might be able to budge it from its resting place, and roll this beast down the hill at my unsuspecting brother. 
I told Jimmy my plan and he just laughed out loud at me shaking his head. As Tim started up the hill, I started heaving that heavy bitch out of its resting place and it shot out of my hands and began moving quickly down the hill, following that old indented trail. 
Timmy around this time was just starting his ascent up our back lot after I managed to set the boulder in motion. It quickly exploded into a full speedy roll gathering momentum every second it was rolling down the steep 40-degree decline toward Timmy. 
So, as I released the boulder the noise it made was masked by his own ascent over the downed branches from the windstorm we got the previous night and he didn’t hear or even notice the loud boulder barreling down the hill toward him while he was crunching on the branches. 
I heard for about six seconds sounds like this, “Crash, crash, crunch, crunch, crash, crash,” as the boulder followed the somewhat depressed pathway all the way down the hill!   
What it actually sounded like was, “Crash, crash, crunch, crunch, crash, crash, crash-ahhhhhhhhh, what the fuck!” As the boulder bowled Timmy down like a lone ten-pin hiding in the corner all by itself!
Funny as fuck we hooted loudly and rolled on the ground in a rip-roaring uncontrollable laugh which took nearly six seconds to recover from. I knew I had just about one minute to run away before Timmy caught up to me and knocked my teeth out. Damn I pranked my older brother good sometimes, didn’t I?
I snuck in later that night in the tent trailer where Timmy had already fallen asleep. The next day Timmy had somewhat calmed down and just looked at me in the morning and he called me a fucking moron!  
Even though we both fucked with each other and had many battles over the years, I loved Timmy very much and would have done anything for him. 
He toughened me up quite a bit over the years, battling with him as Irish brothers often did, but I do not ever regret those battles we had, because in the end, he is still my favorite brother!  
A great deal of crap happened during the earlier years, a lot of partying, fighting, and uncontrollable behavior that somehow became all too familiar with me. Funny, however, dad became much more stable and started being a good influence on me.  
However, my sister Katie, Timmy and I really put my parents through the wringer. 
The three of us often partied, smoking and drinking, while Timmy and I chose to scrape by life doing the bare minimum, which was a shame since Timmy and I were really smart but didn’t prepare ourselves for adulthood by studying and living up to our fullest potentials at all like my oldest brothers did.  
They still had more control over Katie though, forcing her to complete the four years of St. Clair’s Catholic High School and later Katie managed a BSN in Nursing at Northeastern University all still while partying. She completed school and passed her Nursing Boards on the first try. Smart!
The people she hung with were much like our friends as they partied hard and her best friend Patty ended up pregnant in a Catholic high school. 
They tried sending me to Catholic Memorial High School which I attended for 2.5 years but unlike Katie, I never graduated from CM. I had a much different path to follow! 
Another time when I was even younger when I was in the sixth grade, I remember we used to have rock fights. One night while we were having a rock fight I got hit in the eye with a rock and got hurt pretty bad!  
Unfortunately rushed to the wrong hospital, I went to the ER and sat there for four hours until my brother Michael came and told us to go downtown to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a hospital with a great reputation.  
Once I got to the Eye and Ear infirmary at Mass. General, they took 20 minutes to have scopes in my eyes and determined I had a semi-detached right Retina. That was the reason why earlier that day right after I got hit in the eye, I could only see a light blue haze through that eye.
I had to stay in the hospital for two months while my retina fused back into place. I remember my mom reading me Charlotte’s Web in its entirety while I was put on strict bed rest, drugged heavily so I would remain still. 
My right eye three weeks in still was not focusing too well at all and I continued laying there in my hospital bed, heavily sedated wondering if I would ever see through that eye again.  
Later the beginning of the fourth week on a hot June night, I decided to pull my right eye patch back and peek out of my bandages. When I did, I looked out a window that faced west down Storrow Drive and made out a structure in the distance that turned out to be in Kenmore Square.  
It was the Citco sign out over left field bleachers at our famous beloved Fenway Park. I immediately called the nurse through my intercom and she appeared seconds later. I was so happy; I remember my brain was bursting to tell her the good news that I could now finally see.  
She pulled the patch completely off now, with the room lights still dimmed, and then at that moment I was fully able to clearly see that iconic symbol of the Boston Red Sox baseball team’s unofficial logo, the Citco sign, lighting up in the distance with those iridescent lights that shown so colorfully and brightly all over our great city.  
What was somewhat coincidental was just that the next year the Massachusetts Historic Society decided to make the Citco sign a permanent city landmark, a landmark with great personal significance to me! 
When I got out and came home one sunny spring afternoon, I was supposed to remain stationary at home with limited movement for at least another couple of months and slowly could start getting back into a routine. 
In the meantime, David O’Brien came in and started chatting with me. He first apologized for hitting me with the rock but further went on to say, “I got punished for hitting you in the eye and had to miss a school dance that weekend because of you.”  
Well, the nerve of this asshole! I ended up in the hospital for almost two months because of him. I flipped out and began punching him as many times as I could before my dad ran downstairs to break it up. 
I did this without thinking about any possible bad consequences that may happen considering it was right after I left the hospital. It wasn’t very smart!
Age 13 began for me by drinking on the weekends with friends. Marijuana also became somewhat of a habit as well, as I began smoking weed with my brother down the arboretum.  
As we smoked a couple of joints my first time, I remember feeling very euphoric and had a sense of overwhelming excitement as I sat there stoned. This began a love affair I had for weed that lasted 10 years.
One night my brother and I along with six friends decided to break into my neighbor’s house across the street, the Dragonette’s. They lived on the arboretum side of the street, so breaking in would not be very visible to our other neighbors.  
We climbed to the second-floor window by climbing up a trellis, which Mr. Dragonette used to grow his own grapes to produce some of his crappy homemade wine. 
When we first got into the house, we started to look downstairs to see if Mr. Dragonette had any wine fermenting. We actually found some but thought after tasting it we may be better off getting to his kitchen liquor cabinet to steal his hard liquor.  
Just as Timmy and I opened up the liquor cabinet door, we actually heard our mother scream “Chrissy, Timmy time for dinner.” 
We stopped in our tracks, looked at each other and Timmy barked orders to the crew to steal some booze and hide it up the arbs for the next night, a Friday night in early July.  
The next day Timmy and I met with our neighbors up the arbs and we all went up to Motley Hill and walked down the hill where pancake rock stood. We climbed up the pancake and went to the other side where Weld Street divided the 1st and 2nd arbs.  
Now stoked to see that they stole like seven bottles of booze we all sat there opening various bottles and began pounding straight alcohol. 
I began drinking straight gin almost vomiting a few times at its disgusting taste but drank the good part of a pint by myself and quickly went into a blackout.  
We made it to my street and we sat on the Fraine’s wall when all of a sudden, I did not feel too well. It was probably a good thing that I did begin to puke as I had drunk enough to probably kill myself.
Mrs. Abisso who watched me vomiting uncontrollably did escort me from the Fraine’s wall and knocked on our door and my dad answered. 
They brought me into the kitchen and I threw up into a bucket provided to me by my very unhappy father, which dad immediately knew I was drunk off my ass. 
I was still sick and throwing up as he began grilling me over and over about how I got the alcohol. He kept at it until I just broke. I thought if I just told him he would stop his interrogation and let me go to bed.  
I spilled the beans and I mean on everyone. His response was strange as he went across the street and got Mrs. Dragonette and brought her to our kitchen, where I sat there still throwing up into that bucket.  
She looked at me as my dad told her what we did, still scolding me. She, however, interceded and came over and rubbed my head and said, “Poor, poor boy, he has suffered enough, don’t punish him anymore, he learned his lesson.” 
I remember at that point my dad pulled out his checkbook and wrote a check to cover the damages and the cost of the booze we stole as he profusely apologized for our crappy behavior.
Well, Timmy got his ass kicked while I sat there still puking. Everyone, like six more dudes all, got into trouble because dad went to everyone’s house and told the other offender’s parents of our crime. 

Normally I would never have ratted, never! However, I was so fucking sick, I just had to end dad’s incessant cross-examination and the only way to make it stop was admitting to everything. Boy was Timmy pissed!
