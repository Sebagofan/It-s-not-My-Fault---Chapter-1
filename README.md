# It-s-not-My-Fault---Author’s page:
Born in Boston as the fifth and last child in an Irish family in a predominately Irish-Italian neighborhood, I observed massive societal changes right in front of my eyes. 
Witnessing the end of the Cold War, the beginning of the Civil Rights movement, the start, and end of the Vietnam war leading to sex drugs and rock & roll revolution, and seeing first-hand assignations of key prominent leaders, our generation developed a more cynical view of the world and life overall.   
As I reached my teenage years, I was part of the beginning of the desegregation era in our public school system, which meant forced bussing in the early 70s. 
Our generation lived through a lot of turmoil and many families took sides, both pro and against the societal changes. America was at a crossroads! 
Having early symptoms of a Schizoaffective  disorder and not knowing how to deal with life while living symptoms with it, I turned to a process of self-medication. After extensive conflicts early on, I developed a hard outer shell for survival purposes where I felt a little more in control. 
As life progressed, I managed to not let life beat me down and benefitted by having an optimistic demeanor in spite of having deep depression which at times took total hold of me. I however always tried putting myself in the best possible position I could because of an inner desire to not settle for less. 
Having strong family influences both positive and negative became a blessing and a curse! My Dad used to say this about me, “Chris, you step in shit and come out smelling like a rose!” That could best sum up my life!


Chapter 1: The Early Days

Is it possible for a kid to go through a nervous breakdown at age 7? I actually think so, because I sense I did. There are some very personal things that I won’t discuss with you now, but know they had a profound effect on me which lasted a lifetime!	
2nd grade was a really tough year in my life!
Miss O’Leary known as one of the meanest teachers in our public school system just happened to find out that I was smoking cigarettes with some of the other guys. Consequently, she decided to hang me up on a coat hook like a slab of meat at a butcher’s shop for all my classmates to see.  
She kept me hanging there in the coat room for an hour or so to show everybody what happens to kids who disappoint her. Meanwhile, some of the other kids came into the coat room and began laughing at me which only made me lash out swinging and kicking wildly at them.  
That is not all, at the same time twice a week, I also had a CCD class with a second-grade catechism teacher who was named Sister Bennet. She was famous for dueling out a wicked punishment called the rat-tan. 
We considered this a medieval punishment that those nuns would use which amounted to them wailing on their knuckles with a wooden ruler causing extreme amounts of pain.  
She happily gave out this punishment way too often to misbehaving little Catholic boys like myself to keep us under her complete control. One day I tested her patients just one too many times!           
As a middle-class Boston Irish Catholic kid in second grade, I was expected to start Confession and receive Holy Communion that year. This did not go down as planned because of course I had to try sister Bennet and fool around in class. 
Much to my surprise, she was more than willing to meet out my punishment, “the rat-tan” on my knuckles as an example to everybody in the class as to how not to act. 
She grabbed my arm with one hand and swung that damn ruler on my knuckles with the other as hard as she could. The first whack fucking hurt! 
Well, the proverbial shit hit the fan! Before she swung twice, I jumped out of my seat, stood up, kicked her right in the shins, and made my escape out the front door. 
She did not bother to chase me because she was too busy rubbing her very sore shins. I eventually made my way home and much to my surprise, my parents had not even gotten a phone call from her. For some reason, Sister Bennet never bothered to call my home, lucky me, right? 
Weeks passed as I took it upon myself to hook Catechism class while hanging down Roslindale square,up on top of the roofs of all the businesses that occupied the square. I had a bird’s eye view of all the happenings in this pretty tough neighborhood. 
Cigarette smoking and hanging out with my brother and other buddies my age was of course what I did to kill the time I would ordinarily have spent in CCD class.  
Six weeks of doing this went by pretty quickly, when one day my father screamed at me from the living room for me to get my goddamn ass downstairs. 
He showed me the letter he received stating that because of my continued absence from CCD class, I would not be able to receive Holy Communion that year. 
Right then in there, he flipped out, chasing me out of the house trying to catch me to give me an ass kicking! 
Time went by that night and I got home to find my dad a little calmer, but that did not stop him from threatening me with eventual death if I ever hooked CCD class again. 
My dad and I now had to pay a visit with Sister Bennet and I was not looking forward to this scene whatsoever!
When we got there, the class had just started and Sister was in front of the whole class. She looked perturbed having to stop and take time from class to explain to my dad what happened, as he pleaded to Sister that if I didn’t get back into class his mom would kill the both of them! 
She shrieked, “There is nothing I can do about the situation,” he has missed too many classes and won’t be able to receive Holy Communion with his classmates!”  
Oh boy, you should have seen the look on dad’s face when all of a sudden, he just threw up his hands and yelled, “Fuck it, I don’t give a shit about the little bastard,” as he rushed out the door slamming it behind him leaving me standing there awkwardly in front of the completely stunned classroom full of petrified little second graders!
Sister Bennet at this point felt horrible about the scene dad caused and must have felt somewhat responsible because she hugged me seconds later and said, ”Poor boy, Poor boy, I’ll let you back in class and you can still receive Holy Communion with your classmates. Tell your father not to worry!” 
To this point in my life, this seemed to be a reoccurring theme of life events. I always found a way to get into trouble, but for some reason or another always managed somehow to get out of it. Either I had the luck of the Irish or had a very patient angel by my side!
A couple of months later, on the day of my Catechism ceremony, my friends and I broke into the O’Brien’s house with David O’Brien, who was their youngest son.  
His father used to lock him out of the house routinely because David could not be trusted alone in the house. True to form, we went in just to smoke the parliament cigarettes I had just lifted from my mother’s pocketbook. Mr. O’Brien came home unfortunately for me and caught us in the act. 
When I got home my dad must have received a phone call from Mr. O’Brien and he managed to find out about my misdeeds once again. He always had a weird eerie knack for always finding out the shit we got into. He must have had some type of inborn radar when it pertained to me and he always knew what I was up to. 
When I came in to get dressed for the Holy Communion Ceremony, he met me at the door with his belt in hand. 
My grandmother, who I never saw much of and did not even know that well, screamed at him to stop, saying, “Neil, you can’t punish him today, it’s his Holy Communion Day, a special day that should not be remembered for the punishment he got from his own father!”  
Dad looked at me and grumbled, “you lucky little bastard, today’s your lucky day!” Another magical moment in my life when I can look back and wonder, “How the hell did I get away with it again?”  
That fall I got into a lot of scrapes because of that personal thing that I won’t talk about and the older neighborhood kids thought they could intimidate me, but it always ended up with them yelling at me to calm the fuck down as I often scrapped with anyone who would fuck with me and I was often referred to as a crazy son-of-a-bitch! 
Street hockey and football were two sports where my brother and I excelled at and we kind of earned respect through our toughness, never backing down and always playing better than most guys our own age!
Life moved slowly and I dealt with Miss O’Leary and Sister Bennet and I somehow managed to escape into 3rd grade with my classmates. 
I went to confession reluctantly a few more times and did receive my Holy Communion with my class, but as far as CCD went, I knew I was never going back. That was kind of a done deal, the end of my Holy studies or at least until I was in high school at Catholic Memorial for a 2.5 year stint.  
Prior to these events were my dad’s insane behavioral acts which had a profound effect on my psyche. I wish I could blame it on the fact that he was a World War II veteran and in my life several times in the past I made up an excuse that my dad was a corpsman serving in battle with the marines, but this was a cover because the reality of it all was that he saw no action and I made excuses as to why he was so crazy. Why else would he act so insane, right?
Was it because one day when he came home from lunch, mom was on top of the outside of the sleeping bag which was zippered all the way up and had the milk-man was stuck inside it?      
According to her, she was trying to undo the zipper and free our milkman, Dick Boylan from the confines of an Alaskan sleeping bag that he wanted to borrow on a camping trip. Mom was just showing him how warm it was, or that was the excuse she used anyways!
He would pace the hallway unable to sleep at night, in a rage punching the wall and screaming randomly, even at Girt Nolan to go fuck herself, our saintly neighbor who was probably unaware of the verbal assault hurled her way for no particular reason.
Looking back at it now, I see the manic side of my dad way back then but unfortunately for me, things with him declined much worse, but coincidentally when I got older the fidelity mantra became a whole big thing for me too!
When I was about 25, right back from New York just a few years earlier with all the trauma I endured there. I began working track meets with my dad and there was a lady who worked there who had eyes on him and all I could imagine was him doing her too!
All of a sudden, I incoherently blurted out something to my father put him in a headlock, and ran him up six stairs, then pulled him down the same six stairs with him basically probably wondering what the fuck! 
The initial meds the VA had me on to help with paranoia only made shit way worse and I imagined dad cheating on my mom which infuriated me so fucking much!
Mom screamed Chrissy stop, what the hell are you doing? I released my 57-year-old shocked father and you could tell that I hurt his feelings. Whatever I was dreaming up in my mind wasn’t real whatsoever and after I accused him of cheating on mom with that lady, my mom burst out laughing! 
What a weird moment, mom deflated a potentially dangerous moment by explaining, dad would never cheat on her with that woman, she was too damn ugly, and that it was all in my head! 
Embarrassed as I was, I made a heartfelt apology to dad and he just hugged me and told me he loved me and that I’d be alright! 
He previously, however, had a lot of negative influences on me because of some of his insane, crazy antics he pulled in our house when I was 5 years old.
But years later inundated me with some deep devotion that he showered on a son; that in all probability, reminded him to be a bit of himself! Unfortunately, a lot of his early antics would inevitably scar me for most of my teenage and adult life. 
My mom and dad married each other back in the day when couples stayed married for life, as they had done. I realize now I think dad was bipolar, which would explain much of the way he sometimes acted, and not to forget to mention how all of us kids to some degree received his tendencies to be a little bipolar as well.  
I really remember a couple of incidents clearly even today when I was five years old that he did, which messed me up for many years. 
This one summer mostly with the windows all up to capture the summer breeze, my dad and mom had a lot of screaming matches in our home that echoed throughout this very close-knit neighborhood. It often escalated by dad throwing and breaking things, and his anger came out in a threatening controlling violence. 
Two nights in particular, I remember; dad went on a real tear and scared the shit out of us. One terrible night I vividly remember mom and dad fighting hard. I did not know why they were screaming at each other; I only knew it was especially intense that evening and I feared this would be a lot worse than usual.  
At first, I thought I would just be running downstairs to referee a loud screaming match but then ended up trying to wrestle a knife out of dad’s hand. He had taken a kitchen knife from the kitchen drawer and put it to his throat and screamed, “Fuck it, I’ll kill myself then!”  
I found myself in uncharted waters and it was either Timmy or Katie, along with my mother and I who began to wrestle the knife out of his hands. We still witnessed him cutting his throat deep enough to cause blood to spurt out all over the place. 
As we tried to prevent him from continuing in his efforts he knocked me to the floor, we all kept trying to disarm him, keeping him from doing any more damage!  
The sinking feeling in my heart from this was profound! At around five years old I was trying to figure out why the man I loved so much, who had a huge part in raising us, handled anger and grief by acting out in this way. I think this was his way of sowing deep fear in us all.   
Another night month’s later dad did about the same thing again, but this time taking a whole bottle of valiums and chasing them by downing a quart of whiskey as we tried in vain to intervene again, without any effect!  
What I now know, is that he used fear and intimidation as some type of method to control my mother. What I; until now did not realize was that to some degree I tried to emulate him later in life when I was in my own unhealthy relationships.  
Probably considered today as a form of “domestic abuse,” those events if repeated these days would make people today grimace at such behavior and how my mother managed, I’ll never know. 
That kind of behavior might even lead to police action with family court involving interventions with therapists, which may have been thrust upon us if this happened now. Which in actuality may have been helpful!
The horror of those nights haunted me long into the future. Little did I know his actions would have a profound effect on me many years later!  
The holidays always affected him the most for some reason. One time he took the decorated Christmas tree and threw it out the front door into the slushy winter snow, proclaiming he hated Christmas. 
I think it was the whole commercialization of Christmas instead of the celebration it was intended for, which was the birth of Jesus Christ!
At one point in his life, he considered becoming a priest. Wow, go figure!
Another night I remember, he took the Thanksgiving Day turkey and screamed, “there won’t be a fucking Thanksgiving,” then proceeded to throw the bird out in the backyard into the freshly fallen snow.  
My mom defiantly went outside and took the turkey into the house and cleaned it up and served it to the rest of us, while he stormed off upstairs to bed. Just another typical holiday at the Cronin house! 
I remember my dad one time getting into serious trouble at White Stadium where he worked as the Assistant Athletic Director in the Boston Public School System. 
One day during Special Olympics sporting event at White Stadium in July, he really got himself into a jam, that in retrospect I can look back and think to myself just how fucking crazy he really was!
This one summer day it sweltering 94 degree heat during a Special Olympics track meet. Because it was so hot my dad instructed the kids to go and sit under a shady oak tree where he provided paper cups and a 5-gallon cooler with iced water for the young special athletes. 
Well, you will never guess who attended the stadium that day. It was His Eminence, Humberto Sousa Medeiros, the Archbishop of Boston representing the Catholic Church with all its pomp and celebrity.  
The archbishop who I guess thought he was always in control took it upon himself to walk over and tell the kids to move out from underneath the tree so the ambulance could now park there to get out of the hot sun.  
Dad saw the kids now leaving from underneath the shady tree and back into the hot sun as the ambulance moved under the comfort of the shady tree. 
He immediately approached the driver and asked him to move again as His Eminence listened on just feet away. 
The archbishop fatefuly approached my dad scolding him loudly saying, “Mind your business, who do you think you are?” 
Oh boy, you would not believe what happened next?   
Dad screamed “Fuck you, asshole” and began punching the archbishop tackling him to the ground, all while his eminence was decked out wearing those full ceremonial robes including that weird strange black hat that they wore which made it look much more of a spectacle.  
Quickly the police escort who were supposed to be guarding his Eminence all converged on my dad; which in actuality, took all four officers to pry him off the now very shocked Holy Man. 
Dad got an unexpected invite in handcuffs down to precinct 13, a police station near the stadium where he knew most of the officers anyways. He sat in a dank private cell for a few days!
A couple of days later they escorted him to the VA mental ward and he stayed there for a month to treat his nutty behavior.  
I remember going to visit him at the VA hospital with Timmy and he gave me a wallet he made during an arts and crafts therapy session. Boy was he three sheets to the wind! They had him stoned on something, probably Thorazine. Wow, this was too surreal; dad was locked up because he was dangerous, go figure right!?
That summer apparently when dad recovered enough, we started camping all over when I was about six years old. I remember camping down at Cape Cod, and going to Vermont, New Hampshire, and all throughout Maine. Camping in the summer meant leaving the hustle and bustle of our beloved congested city of Boston.  
I had so many childhood memories camping all over New England. One time camping down in Cape Cod as dad was fishing in the canal. Timmy fell into the very strong Cape Cod Canal and the current swept him away. 
Michael who just became a lifeguard at the YMCA, jumped into the canal, swam after him despite the almost overbearing current, and rescued him from a probable drowning.  
So, I used to hang out with dad at White Stadium when I was about 7 in the summer. One particular day I went looking for him because Frank McCormick asked me to find dad and have him move his truck.
Well, when I approached his office, I heard behind closed doors some woman giggling in his office! This room conveniently had a bed-cot with the first aid cabinet in it where the nurse handily shared a room with my dad. 
When I knocked on the door, they all of a sudden became really quiet. Then I persisted in knocking loudly again this time yelling Dad I know you’re in there. Boy, what a pain in the ass that must have been!
Dad said, “Go away Chris I’m busy right now!” So, I just forgot my assignment and left, a little disturbed he was in there with the nurse giggling though!
Well, when I got home, I went right in and told my mom dad had me locked out of his office he and the nurse were in there giggling and he told me to leave because he was too busy!
Oh shit, did that start a fucking war! Mom had the fridge open as I told her this and she began whipping everything inside the fridge at him including cans, jars, and eggs. He was basically screwed! 
After the melee was over and in front of my dad. My mother told my dad he would be taking me to work every day that summer and that I was to keep an eye on him. Mind you I was only 7 years old.
The ride to work the next day was quiet, except for the part that day he called me a rat fink! But sorry, dad, (!) that’s my mom's buddy and I think he understood after all even back then although I adored him, I loved her too! 
Did I then pick up the lifelong trait of putting fidelity as being something extremely important, something I would obsess about to the extreme later in life to the point where it was debilitating? Maybe!
I can tell dad stories forever since he was a character like me. But there was one thing about my father that I can tell you now, he was extremely defensive when it came to his family!  
When I was at White Stadium that summer there was this incident where the sporting goods supply room at the stadium got broken into by some of dad’s workers. 
You see, at White Stadium, we held onto all the sporting equipment that would be delivered to all the Boston Public Schools! 
One day, there was this one worker who witnessed the break-in and he left a note on my dad’s desk ratting on the workers who broke into the storage room.
Dad I remember, played it cool and said he got a ride home from one of the suspects because coincidently that afternoon I lost his keys playing toss in the air with them as I threw it up in the air, I lost it in the sun and just went about my business forgetting I just lost dad’s keys!
Dad however, knew this guy had the stuff in his trunk and somehow got the guy to open it for him and busted him right there and then in front of me.
Well as pissed as he was, dad reported this one guy who was also a tenured teacher who we found out lost both jobs eventually once the superintendent of the schools found out about it. So needless to say, this guy was totally pissed! 
Here’s the thing. This guy thought I was the rat who finked on him and as dad and I were walking by him at lunch the day after, he threatened to slap the shit out of me!
Dad calmly walked over to him, then abruptly screamed “what mother fucker” and began hammering this piece of shit in the head with right hooks as he fell to the ground. Don’t ever threaten my son you bastard he screamed as he finished beating this guy.
The truth came out and the real rat was found out. It was this real skinny worker kid, whom they stripped naked and taped his hands and ankles together and left him there on the ground as dad and I got back into the stadium from lunch. Dad just handed me a knife and said “cut him loose!”

Another time I think around 1967 in New Hampshire, we went camping up in the White Mountains near Pinkham’s Notch. 
On this particular night; which happened to be my birthday on July 31, we were camping celebrating my birthday having cake and ice cream. Strangely enough, another family we noticed with a much bigger group were also having a birthday celebration just two campsites over from ours!
Their crowd was rather large as they surrounded a beautiful blazing campfire while they all sang happy birthday to the young boy who was around my age.   
It seemed to be getting late as I snuggled in a heavy woolen blanket on a cot with my family, as we were just finishing our celebration. 
There was an older woman over at the other party who grabbed some charcoal lighter fluid and began squirting it into the roaring fire, instantly making a loud boom as the lighter fluid hit the flame.  
What happened next, I’ll never forget! As she continued squeezing the lighter fluid can into the fire, the flames vaulted 12 feet into the air, but as she released her squeeze and the can began sucking the air back in, the flames which were now high as hell, followed the vapor trail back up into the can, exploding it instantly!  
I heard two booms that night. The first was when the fuel had initially hit the flames of the fire, which drew my attention; then a few seconds later was the second explosion as fire vaulted into the lighter fluid can following the vapor trail back to the can, exploding the 28 once container like a bomb! 
The explosion of the can completely left the elderly woman engulfed in fire! She immediately began running and I watched her viciously screaming in what I imagined was excruciating unimaginable pain.  
As she ran around the campsite now completely consumed by fire, trails of flames fell off her igniting the woods around the campsite as she ran. 
I’ll never forget how she resembled a human torch after the explosions, which were followed by the haunting extreme frantic screams which have stayed with me all these years later! 
Considering I was only eight years old when the event happened, it did not scare me all that much. My dad’s immediate reaction to seeing her running as a human torch was rather heroic though! 
He grabbed the blanket I had wrapped myself up in and charged toward the chaotic scene. As she was still both running around now completely enveloped by fire, the scene of him tackling the burning woman to the ground probably seared the memory into my brain for life!  
Right after he tackled her, he began rolling her in the blanket repeatedly rolling her over and over to extinguish her flames. She had third and fourth-degree burns on almost 80% of her body. 
The full-thickness of third-degree burns had spread throughout her whole body, extending to most of her upper torso and to all the layers of her face.  
Some fourth-degree burns additionally covered her neck and face involving a deeper injury to tissues including the face muscles, tendons, and even her eyes. Her hair and most of her clothes completely burnt off; filling the air with a disgusting burnt stench I can still recall all these years later!
The next morning was unnervingly silent, until my brother Neil told me the woman died as he started playing the Beatles song “Eleanor Rigby" written by Paul McCartney. 
It was one of the most surreal moments that early morning capsulizing the previous night’s events as I reflected on the horror, while now listening to the eeriness of the music and its equally disturbing lyrics. 
  
 "Eleanor Rigby"
Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 
 Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
 Lives in a dream
 Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
 Who is it for?
 
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?
 
 Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
 No one comes near
 Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
 What does he care?
 
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?
 
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 
 Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
 Nobody came
 Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
 No one was saved
 
 All the lonely people
 (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
 Where do they all belong? 

 
 
As I stared into the foggy meadows now surrounded by the mist and fog obscuring half of the mountain we were camped up next to, while listening to the song Eleanor Rigby, it left such an indelible image of the woman’s horrible death and subsequent sad burial that the song lyrics now depicted, as I imagined it being this poor woman who was now dead! 
Not to be outdone, I remember on another birthday morning, wakening early and walking down the stairs from my bedroom and to see a weird scene. There was so much fog outside, you couldn’t see more than 10 feet in front of you. Never ever had I seen it so foggy like that before. 
This would be the second horrific event on my birthday as a jetliner crashed at Logan Airport. It was a Delta Air Lines DC-9 twin-engine jetliner Flight 723, which was operating as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Burlington, Vermont to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. 
On July 31, 1973, at 11:08 AM, while on an instrument approach into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the glide path, struck a seawall with its landing gear, and crashed, killing all but two of its 89 occupants.  
Both survivors later died of their injuries as they were both burned terribly. 
Extreme heavy fog was reportedly the reason for the crash leaving all dead but the two survivors, as one died that night, while the other, Leopold Chouinard, eventually succumb to his burn injuries on December 11, 1973. Six months of hell!
Besides these two events, for me, however, a late July birthday was always wicked cool. Celebrating in July sure beat celebrating in January like my brother Timmy had to do.
Even going out to a restaurant with my parents became a little bit hazardous back then. As one night, I can remember with just mom, dad, and myself at a restaurant, dad began seething that he was going to fucking kill someone. 
Out of the blue, dad hauls back and whips a bud bottle and hits this guy right in the head, leaps up, runs over and grabs him off the seat and throws him on the floor, and begins punching this guy in the head. 
The waitress screamed, and we heard someone else say, call the police. So, dad got all of us and we left immediately without even paying. He was truly nuts!
Second grade rolled into third and fourth and so on. By the sixth grade, many neighborhood kids including myself were doing stupid things, like drinking on the weekends, and even progressed into us sniffing glue as I think I sought to forget my childhood completely! 
During this period of time, we had rock fights and unfortunately for me, I got hit in the right eye and had a detached retina as a result.
Recently asked by a loved one, why we did those stupid things like drinking and drugs and I could only reply by saying, “I thought it was a combination of us trying to escape reality, possibly having alcoholic tendencies, and probable for me unknowingly doing a lot of self-medicating.”   
Years later, my diagnosis and subsequent advancing symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia materialized and became part of how my life which drastically changed with this onset, led to uncontrollable bouts of paranoia leading to me accusing girlfriends of infidelity in relationships while irrationally and constantly looking for evidence of this truth.  
A lot more regarding this truth had owned me for years and is discussed in detail later on. But first, look at the events that led up to this time, as my life by no means was a normal one.
During the early days in Sebago Lake State Park which were, however the most memorable in my youth, we continued enjoying the lake and having fun. 
My parents actually liked the area so much from camping up there, that they bought land in Naples, Maine which bordered Sebago Lake around 1968. 
My dad first bought two, 100’X 50’ lots and we started bringing our new tent trailer up there camping and spending most of the summers in Naples.  
The land’s location was atop a huge hill in the foothills of the White Mountains, which were some twenty miles away from New Hampshire. This development sold lots for camping use and we bought four more lots together now enabling us to put a septic tank in for a mobile home they eventually bought.  
I remember dad; with our help, cleared the land by making huge bonfires and burning the brush. The fire’s smoke that came from the burning pine branches brought the attention of fire marshals, tipped off by a fire spotter stationed all the way over in New Hampshire in the White Mountains. 
Dad loved his Naples getaway and he eventually bought 12 lots in total over a space of eight years. The three youngest kids in our family, Katie, Timmy, and I got the most out of our Maine campsite. 
Dad and I started bonding back in those days and I remember the time dad and I would take the Old Town canoe down at Muddy River and he’d take me fishing. 
This one day, we got up early and got in our canoe and we caught several large trout. Dad said he’d show me how to clean and cook the fish and we’d have them for breakfast. Yah, like fish and eggs for breakfast, cool!
One time this huge fish dad caught finally got in the boat and it was truly impressive! By now dad and I had caught three, and he was going to have a fish fry again. But all of a sudden, that big fish began to flip and flop, and jump and dad instinctively took off his moccasin and smacked this fish. Knocked it out cold! 
Well, we began heading to shore and the damn fish gave it one more herculean effort and flung itself right over the boat and swam away victoriously leaving us in its wake!
We were city kids at heart but would now morph more into half-country kids, half-city kids, with both influences changing our life perspectives. 
From the ages between eight and all the way up until I turned closer to eleven years old, we somewhat behaved ourselves with relatively no issues. 
As we got older however while this area eventually developed bringing more families where we eventually would make more friends, some of whom we would raise hell with way too often in the future. 
We met friends who were from Lewiston Maine called the Terrians. Bert and Ricky Terrian were wild Mainers who we got along with and hung out with for years.
I remember being with Ricky who thought it was a good idea to hotwire this rowboat and I had a canoe with an engine in it, not mine by the way, just borrowed kind of illegally you could say. 
He basically dared me to play chicken with him with it on Muddy River as nighttime closed in and we both throttled out machines full bore of course my canoe was up in the air because nobody was in the front of it, so it just overrode the other boat and they both just kind of turned in circles all hung up on themselves. 
This brings me to another time when Timmy’s friends, Jimmy Cameron and Mikey Burke came up to Maine. Some of Tim’s Boston buddies and we all got into our 18’ Old Town canoe, filled with four cases of beer and invited four girls to come hang out with us at Sandy Beach, about a mile or so paddle. 
As soon as we went through the bridge and came into big Sebago Lake the waves of the lake capsized the canoe. 
Do you think we immediately rescued the 2 girls who couldn’t swim? NO! Instead, we just began diving for the cases of beer and the poor girls were all hanging onto the half-sunken canoe for dear life! Not our proudest moment mind you!
By thirteen I was a weekend warrior, drinking beer, smoking pot, and sometimes both. On the weekends we came up from Boston and always ended up partying at different various places that we named Big Beach and Little Beach, nicknames everyone around our area called the two beaches off Muddy River which was Sebago Lake’s main tributary. 
We eventually made a secluded spot behind an old farm and named it Smokies Den. Campfires were always part of our experience and we were always careful not to light the woods on fire.   
On a hot summer day when I was around fifteen years old, I was hanging with Rusty Lashua, a childhood friend who had a camp at the end of our road. 
We climbed up in this 150-year-old tree which had a 6’ wide circumference on it, lit up a joint, and began smoking it. The year before we built a tire swing using a 3” thick rope and an old trailer tire which was really high up in the air.  
So, this one day as we were still up in the tree smoking this joint, Timmy approached us from our lot above. I put up one finger up to my mouth and whistled shhhh, which meant for Rusty to shut the fuck up!  
As Timmy approached us, I remember him humming something somewhat loudly. We did all we could do to keep from laughing aloud. 
Timmy got into the tire swing and started pushing off the old pine tree trunk. As he got up momentum, the humming continued to get louder as his speed and trajectory increased. 
I so happened to be carrying a jack-knife on me and I motioned to Rusty to again stop snickering.  
As Timmy swung freely back and forth, I was busy sawing the 3” thick rope. Almost as if Timmy were a cartoon figure humming and swinging like a madman, I managed to cut the final threads of the 3” rope just as Timmy reached the highest trajectory of his swing. 
It sounded rather like this, “Lalala, nanana, ladiladi-La Nanana, Ahhhhhh oh-Fuckkkkk!” as Timmy flew into the air for three seconds, landing with himself still inside the tire, now rolling down the steep hill and bouncing off the remains of this 200-year-old rock wall which eventually stopped him some 60’ away from where the tire swing used to hang.  
He got out of the tire dropping many f-bombs when he heard Rusty and I laughing hysterically in the tree above. As my father used to say, “The shit hit the fan!”  
Timmy got to his feet and began screaming he was going to fucking kill me! While initially hysterically laughing, I started climbing up the tree instinctually, not giving it much thought until a huge fist-sized rock bounced off the branch directly above me, hitting right above my head and ripping a huge chunk of bark off the tree.  
We began climbing as fast as we could, as the rocks he was throwing whizzed by us several times a second. He screamed, “You stupid mother fucker, I hurt my damn arm, I’m going to fucking kill you, you stupid fuckhead!” 
This tree was huge and the top of the tree must have been 250’ tall, once we both reached it, the White Mountains and Mount Washington were all in sight. We did reach the top very quickly, which was partly the reason I escaped being smacked by flying rocks. 
He continued screaming at me, promising my eventual ass-kicking would come very soon. When I saw my parents pulling into the driveway in their old Volvo station wagon, I knew I needed my dad to rescue me before crazy Timmy’s rocks found their target. 
I immediately began screaming to my dad, “Help, help, dad help, this crazy bastard is trying to kill us!” Dad came right down and came up to Timmy who was still hurling big stones at us. 
Dad grabbed Timmy and wrestled with him briefly and asked Timmy what was going on as he now very excitedly screamed to him what we did.  
Dad begged Tim to calm down, which he immediately did, once dad had a hold of him, preventing him from hurling any more rocks in my direction. 
Dad saved me again, a reoccurring theme he would later repeat many more times in my life. 
Another time after a night of partying at Big Beach, the bigger of the two beaches on Muddy River we hung out at, Jim O’Connor and I walked back up to the camp now a little buzzed from drinking beers. 
About Five minutes after we reached the upper lot at my parent’s place, Timmy arrived and began climbing the trail to the upper lot.  
The trail was over 200’ long and at the top, my father used some of the old 200-year-old rock walls which he rebuilt as a retention wall to keep the gravel he dumped to level the top of the lot and cover up the septic tank he had installed from eroding away, which also formed an area where we had a huge campfire sitting area at. 
Next to the wall were other random boulders lining a walkway, some too big to move, but others I thought quickly to myself might be able to be rolled! 
As Timmy approached the road below which led to the beginning of the trail, I saw a boulder that I thought I could roll. It was a massive boulder, probably weighing close to 400 pounds or more.  
Given the fact that it was fairly round, I therefore imagined I might be able to budge it from its resting place, and roll this beast down the hill at my unsuspecting brother. 
I told Jimmy my plan and he just laughed out loud at me shaking his head. As Tim started up the hill, I started heaving that heavy bitch out of its resting place and it shot out of my hands and began moving quickly down the hill, following that old indented trail. 
Timmy around this time was just starting his ascent up our back lot after I managed to set the boulder in motion. It quickly exploded into a full speedy roll gathering momentum every second it was rolling down the steep 40-degree decline toward Timmy. 
So, as I released the boulder the noise it made was masked by his own ascent over the downed branches from the windstorm we got the previous night and he didn’t hear or even notice the loud boulder barreling down the hill toward him while he was crunching on the branches. 
I heard for about six seconds sounds like this, “Crash, crash, crunch, crunch, crash, crash,” as the boulder followed the somewhat depressed pathway all the way down the hill!   
What it actually sounded like was, “Crash, crash, crunch, crunch, crash, crash, crash-ahhhhhhhhh, what the fuck!” As the boulder bowled Timmy down like a lone ten-pin hiding in the corner all by itself!
Funny as fuck we hooted loudly and rolled on the ground in a rip-roaring uncontrollable laugh which took nearly six seconds to recover from. I knew I had just about one minute to run away before Timmy caught up to me and knocked my teeth out. Damn I pranked my older brother good sometimes, didn’t I?
I snuck in later that night in the tent trailer where Timmy had already fallen asleep. The next day Timmy had somewhat calmed down and just looked at me in the morning and he called me a fucking moron!  
Even though we both fucked with each other and had many battles over the years, I loved Timmy very much and would have done anything for him. 
He toughened me up quite a bit over the years, battling with him as Irish brothers often did, but I do not ever regret those battles we had, because in the end, he is still my favorite brother!  
A great deal of crap happened during the earlier years, a lot of partying, fighting, and uncontrollable behavior that somehow became all too familiar with me. Funny, however, dad became much more stable and started being a good influence on me.  
However, my sister Katie, Timmy and I really put my parents through the wringer. 
The three of us often partied, smoking and drinking, while Timmy and I chose to scrape by life doing the bare minimum, which was a shame since Timmy and I were really smart but didn’t prepare ourselves for adulthood by studying and living up to our fullest potentials at all like my oldest brothers did.  
They still had more control over Katie though, forcing her to complete the four years of St. Clair’s Catholic High School and later Katie managed a BSN in Nursing at Northeastern University all still while partying. She completed school and passed her Nursing Boards on the first try. Smart!
The people she hung with were much like our friends as they partied hard and her best friend Patty ended up pregnant in a Catholic high school. 
They tried sending me to Catholic Memorial High School which I attended for 2.5 years but unlike Katie, I never graduated from CM. I had a much different path to follow! 
Another time when I was even younger when I was in the sixth grade, I remember we used to have rock fights. One night while we were having a rock fight I got hit in the eye with a rock and got hurt pretty bad!  
Unfortunately rushed to the wrong hospital, I went to the ER and sat there for four hours until my brother Michael came and told us to go downtown to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a hospital with a great reputation.  
Once I got to the Eye and Ear infirmary at Mass. General, they took 20 minutes to have scopes in my eyes and determined I had a semi-detached right Retina. That was the reason why earlier that day right after I got hit in the eye, I could only see a light blue haze through that eye.
I had to stay in the hospital for two months while my retina fused back into place. I remember my mom reading me Charlotte’s Web in its entirety while I was put on strict bed rest, drugged heavily so I would remain still. 
My right eye three weeks in still was not focusing too well at all and I continued laying there in my hospital bed, heavily sedated wondering if I would ever see through that eye again.  
Later the beginning of the fourth week on a hot June night, I decided to pull my right eye patch back and peek out of my bandages. When I did, I looked out a window that faced west down Storrow Drive and made out a structure in the distance that turned out to be in Kenmore Square.  
It was the Citco sign out over left field bleachers at our famous beloved Fenway Park. I immediately called the nurse through my intercom and she appeared seconds later. I was so happy; I remember my brain was bursting to tell her the good news that I could now finally see.  
She pulled the patch completely off now, with the room lights still dimmed, and then at that moment I was fully able to clearly see that iconic symbol of the Boston Red Sox baseball team’s unofficial logo, the Citco sign, lighting up in the distance with those iridescent lights that shown so colorfully and brightly all over our great city.  
What was somewhat coincidental was just that the next year the Massachusetts Historic Society decided to make the Citco sign a permanent city landmark, a landmark with great personal significance to me! 
When I got out and came home one sunny spring afternoon, I was supposed to remain stationary at home with limited movement for at least another couple of months and slowly could start getting back into a routine. 
In the meantime, David O’Brien came in and started chatting with me. He first apologized for hitting me with the rock but further went on to say, “I got punished for hitting you in the eye and had to miss a school dance that weekend because of you.”  
Well, the nerve of this asshole! I ended up in the hospital for almost two months because of him. I flipped out and began punching him as many times as I could before my dad ran downstairs to break it up. 
I did this without thinking about any possible bad consequences that may happen considering it was right after I left the hospital. It wasn’t very smart!
Age 13 began for me by drinking on the weekends with friends. Marijuana also became somewhat of a habit as well, as I began smoking weed with my brother down the arboretum.  
As we smoked a couple of joints my first time, I remember feeling very euphoric and had a sense of overwhelming excitement as I sat there stoned. This began a love affair I had for weed that lasted 10 years.
One night my brother and I along with six friends decided to break into my neighbor’s house across the street, the Dragonette’s. They lived on the arboretum side of the street, so breaking in would not be very visible to our other neighbors.  
We climbed to the second-floor window by climbing up a trellis, which Mr. Dragonette used to grow his own grapes to produce some of his crappy homemade wine. 
When we first got into the house, we started to look downstairs to see if Mr. Dragonette had any wine fermenting. We actually found some but thought after tasting it we may be better off getting to his kitchen liquor cabinet to steal his hard liquor.  
Just as Timmy and I opened up the liquor cabinet door, we actually heard our mother scream “Chrissy, Timmy time for dinner.” 
We stopped in our tracks, looked at each other and Timmy barked orders to the crew to steal some booze and hide it up the arbs for the next night, a Friday night in early July.  
The next day Timmy and I met with our neighbors up the arbs and we all went up to Motley Hill and walked down the hill where pancake rock stood. We climbed up the pancake and went to the other side where Weld Street divided the 1st and 2nd arbs.  
Now stoked to see that they stole like seven bottles of booze we all sat there opening various bottles and began pounding straight alcohol. 
I began drinking straight gin almost vomiting a few times at its disgusting taste but drank the good part of a pint by myself and quickly went into a blackout.  
We made it to my street and we sat on the Fraine’s wall when all of a sudden, I did not feel too well. It was probably a good thing that I did begin to puke as I had drunk enough to probably kill myself.
Mrs. Abisso who watched me vomiting uncontrollably did escort me from the Fraine’s wall and knocked on our door and my dad answered. 
They brought me into the kitchen and I threw up into a bucket provided to me by my very unhappy father, which dad immediately knew I was drunk off my ass. 
I was still sick and throwing up as he began grilling me over and over about how I got the alcohol. He kept at it until I just broke. I thought if I just told him he would stop his interrogation and let me go to bed.  
I spilled the beans and I mean on everyone. His response was strange as he went across the street and got Mrs. Dragonette and brought her to our kitchen, where I sat there still throwing up into that bucket.  
She looked at me as my dad told her what we did, still scolding me. She, however, interceded and came over and rubbed my head and said, “Poor, poor boy, he has suffered enough, don’t punish him anymore, he learned his lesson.” 
I remember at that point my dad pulled out his checkbook and wrote a check to cover the damages and the cost of the booze we stole as he profusely apologized for our crappy behavior.
Well, Timmy got his ass kicked while I sat there still puking. Everyone, like six more dudes all, got into trouble because dad went to everyone’s house and told the other offender’s parents of our crime. 

Normally I would never have ratted, never! However, I was so fucking sick, I just had to end dad’s incessant cross-examination and the only way to make it stop was admitting to everything. Boy was Timmy pissed!
Chapter 2: Our Experimentation Days
 
We started experimenting with minor drugs around 14 years old, like hits of THC, mescaline, windowpane (LSD) and other mind-altering drugs that would occupy us 6-10 hours on any given day, usually on a Saturday. Mostly we just smoked pot though! 	
Coincidentally this is when I started hearing voices that I now suspect were symptoms of early onset schizophrenia which I honestly think I began drugging myself on purpose to kill the voices or dull their strength, but to only in fact strengthen their frequency and intensity!
Many times, I recollect I had noticeable auditory hallucinations where I could read peoples thoughts almost like an insanely accurate intuition of what they were thinking and often was proven right by my accuracy of me being able to predict what was said or done next! 
Even today I believe I am telepathic which means according to Webster Dictionary is supposedly capable of transmitting thoughts to other people and them to me and I take it a bit further and think I have a keen sense to read peoples thoughts. 
One of my first LSD trips was with Jimmy and Ogg up the arbs. We were tripping balls on LSD and Jimmy on top of Motley Hill (called Peters or Bussey’s Hill by today’s yuppies) decided to blow his nose and throw his snotty napkin on the ground.  
Damn if that did not get my goat! Since I was tripping so hard, I took it upon myself to lecture Jimmy for what must have been 15 minutes of deep amounts of self-righteous indignation on how he could possibly litter the Arnold Arboretum, a tree museum full of historic relevance that featured Revolutionary War gravesites behind our house in the arbs. 
Jimmy for the whole 15 minutes just stood there staring back at me taking in everything I was articulating tripping balls and finally looked me right in the eyes and said, “For fuck sakes, what are you fucking Euell Gibbons or something, shut the fuck up!” 
God that is all Ogg needed to hear, he laughed and laughed repeating the now new nickname Jimmy inadvertently gave me, “Euell Gibbons!” 
So henceforth, I was now going to be known by many as Euell, but only a few were allowed to call me it! Some guys who heard the nickname tried calling this to me but I thought it was disrespectful since we had no real history together and I would threaten them to never say it again. Although Jimmy was the originator of my name, Ogg was responsible for making it stick. 
Ogg argues today that he was the one who came up with the name, but seeing it was 45 years ago, I don’t think he remembers it that clearly! 
Ogg was given his name as a kid by his street hockey team players because they said he looked like a cave man. They gave him his name “Ogg” which drove him to come up with everybody’s own unique nickname he cleverly came up with usually while we were baked. 
I guess I named Jimmy O’Connor “Chink Eyes,” because Jimmy’s eyes when stoned looked slanted like a Clinamen’s. But for the most part, Ogg invented the majority of nick-names we were all familiar with. 
John O’Hearn got the nickname “Dah” because while up the arboretum on pancake rock, smoking a ton of weed, Ogg and I looked at John being goofy as usual and we both decided to simultaneously push him down this huge cliff nicknamed “Pancake Rock!”  
John being very athletic actually was able to keep his balance and run down this wicked steep decline turning around toward the bottom to scream, “Ahh you fuckers, I made it!”  
Still moving quite fast he ran through a 6” deep muddy puddle where he got his white converse sneakers covered in thick black mud and seconds later completely slipped getting covered in mud. Ogg and I laughed so hard and then Ogg yelled out “Duh, Duh, you’re fucking Duh!” This stuck forever too!
Christy O’Hearn got his nickname from Ogg as well. Ogg gave him the name “Crusty” unceremoniously one day when we were all gathered up in Chrissy’s attic getting high and Ogg looked down at Chrissy, who was just wearing his white BVD’s and started laughing aloud and then blurted out, “Look his fucking underwear is crusty WTF, “Crusty!” 
This became Chrissy’s nickname but because he was still quite a scary dude no one except the guys in that room were ever able to call him this.  
Tom Greely an older friend of ours would get weed from Crusty, John’s brother and then often drove us around getting us all high with it. He came by our neighborhood to hang out with us often and knew Jimmy Creaser very well too.  
We nicknamed Tom “Ganges Greely” for smoking Ganges weed out of a German Meerschaum pipe during a Black Sabbath concert. He made the mistake of passing his pipe down the row to a few chicks we did not even know and somewhere along the line someone pocketed his beautiful Meerschaum pipe.  
Then there was Billy J and Chris J. They were big tough Lebanese brothers who were older and we hung with them mainly to get high and supply them from weed from John’s brother.
This one day, Billy and I went for a drive in his Fiat down the J-Way and out of the blue, a huge Cadillac almost ran us off the road. 
If you knew Billy like I knew him, that wasn’t going to fly. Jamming to Pink Floyd Money, and smoking a J, Billy races up to him and doing about 100 mph, cuts him off and whips around him with that J hanging out of his mouth. 
I was so scared watching those massive Oak trees whipping by that I just sat back and thought wtf! He then took out a rubber mallet from under his seat, leaned out the car and whaled it on this guy’s hood of his car and proceeded to drive around him never stopping, as the driver in this huge Cadillac was in total shock as Billy J blew right by him doing 120 mph!
Knowing The Jamaica Way was rated one of the deadliest roads in America, I had visions of a fatal accident that never happened! Billy was talented and very crazy!!!
Ogg virtually nicknamed everyone he knew giving a new name to many as a way to deflect from his own nickname of Ogg. Everybody called him Ogg, even my mother who he in return was nicknamed Attila by Ogg. I imagine it bothered him to some degree, but he was cool about it! 
At about the same period of time, I loved skiing in New Hampshire with Michael my oldest brother. Most of the time I went skiing with Michael and kids he was in charge of from the YES program. Hanging with Mike usually meant that I would be sober and not smoking weed! 
This would change as one time, I brought John O’Hearn with me. As we rose up the mountain on the ski lift it began snowing hard. John lit a joint and we began smoking it. Since we were heading to the top of the mountain, we passed the first ski ramp, but we were not getting off there, we were heading to the top.  
My damn poles at that moment however had slid down as we came upon the ramp since by now, I was getting too stoned, breaking both poles instantly leaving two little stubs. John laughed hysterically as we continued climbing in the ski-lift up the mountain still snowing, still smoking that joint.  
John then said, “Hey Yule we should race to the bottom, I bet I can kick your ass!” Because I was stoned and embarrassed for breaking my poles my giant ego said, “Sure let’s do it!”  
We got off the lift and I started skiing down the hill with John in the lead. I decided then that I wasn’t going to lose to him, fuck him, he just laughed at me, so I just crouched down and skied straight down the mountain like some possessed fucking Olympic downhill skier without any slalom action to slow me down!  
I found myself skiing very fast hitting patches of ice which quickened my decent. Like a drunken amateur I quickly passed John taking the lead with my little stubby poles, hearing him laugh even louder at that point. I must have been going 65 mph when I shot over a steep ridge, only to land below, on this poor 70-year-old unsuspecting woman, wiping her out instantly!  
I managed however to avoid a direct head on collision, avoiding her a split second before impact, but enough to almost give her a fucking heart attack. I wiped both of us out and went into a head over heels roll down the icy slope. John victoriously passed me by almost a minute later laughing his ass off still!  
John and I always had been very competitive whether it was playing football, billiards, ping-pong, street hockey, skiing or anything that would incite rivalry. 
John and Ogg often would both fuck with me up until I started getting really pissed. At that point both of them having a somewhat healthy fear of me often would back off, but not until they embarrassed me deeply!
Ogg denies this totally, but I still think they thought I was still pretty nuts so the ribbing I took never got too bad. 
Another time hanging with Ricky and Bert Terrian, we decided to go to Malden and have a sleep over at Donna Spinelli’s house. 
Donna and Diane were Italian girls we hung out with who also had a place in Maine but were from Malden, Ma. and we got invited for a sleep over down in Massachusetts. So, Tim and I met Bert and Ricky, two guys from Lewiston Maine who also partied at Naples with us.
As we got there, as their mom welcomed us in and told us she’d have dinner ready for us like around 5:30 or so! 
We accepted of course trying to be polite and we got downstairs and Bert somehow snuck in like 3 cases of beer. 
That’s not all! He talked all of us guys into dropping acid and reluctantly we all did so, forgetting the fact that in two hours from that time, Mrs. Spinelli was going to have dinner ready for us all to eat.
If you know anything about LSD, you’d know you just about start peaking about two hours from taking the LSD and at that moment, Donna’s mom called downstairs and said “you guys come upstairs right now, dinners ready!”
OMG what a scene! I call it hotdog mountain! There must have been like 30 red hotdogs stacked up like a fucking pyramid and since we were all tripping balls, no one could eat anything! 
I felt horrified! Here is this poor woman going out of her way and we all just sat there just giggling at hotdog mountain! 
Feeling feelings intensely since I was now tripping my ass off, I grabbed a hotdog and put some mustard and relish on it. Not the least bit hungry mind you! And I put it in my mouth! 
Crunch, crunch, crunch I chewed this red piece of meat, but it wouldn’t go down my throat! It was basically fucking just stuck there and I was in trouble! My eyes began watering and I was chocking, then I grabbed some damn lemonade that she made and washed it down, thank God. But I wasn’t going to try another friggin bite!  
Bert, Timmy, Ricky and the other Ricky were all laughing their nuts off at me and Mrs. Spinelli asked us “what’s wrong.” 
Donna knew immediately we were all on something and said, don’t worry mom they’ll eat it later and she went off into the other room perplexed as we ran downstairs like freaking idiots that we all were! 
OMG I’m so sorry Mrs. Spinelli! Thanks for the food! Sorry we couldn’t eat your hotdog mountain! We were all too fucked up! At least I tried!
Catholic Memorial days were fun. My best friend Jim O’Connor who at first lived on my street, eventually moved to Cape Cod in Hyannis before my near second grade nervous breakdown happened and eventually moved back to the next town over when I graduated from junior high. 
We rekindled our friendship and often hung out on weekends and on some school days. Of course it meant drinking and by this time we started smoking marijuana. Weed was a drug we all fell in love with that changed our personalities quite a bit. 
This changed me for sure from a casual weekend warrior to an almost every day partier that smoked daily, which eventually led to experimentation with other street drugs.  
Jim and I started hanging out with Ogg and John and sometimes with John’s older brother. The four of us, John, Ogg, Jimmy and I became a close interwoven pack of friends who became inseparable during these early days. 
Timmy split his time hanging out with us and his new gang of friends who drank heavy as Timmy preferred doing, they nicknamed themselves “The Dirtbags.”  
They were also into mischief as we were, constantly getting into fights with others they crossed. All of them took on the character names of the Star Trek enterprise crew, where Timmy became “Bones.” Everyone called Timmy bones, maybe except for me because he was just Timmy to me. 
Timmy one night up in the Arbs confronted the Torgersen’s for breaking bottles. He yelled at the two x-marines explaining that this was all of our homes and that they should stop it.  
They told him to fuck off and continued smashing bottles as Timmy screamed, “You mother fuckers stop breaking the damn bottles,” which prompted them to jump Timmy breaking a rib and chipping one of his teeth. I know damn well if I were there that night the shit would not have gone down like that. 
First of all, they definitely wouldn’t have jumped Timmy as I would have taken on one of the much older brothers and Timmy would have fought the other. I regret that I was not there that night to fight those jerks as I am sure things would have turned out much different than it did.  
John’s oldest brother was a war hero who served in the 101st Airborne Ranger division and fought in Vietnam during the Tet offensive. He received three purple hearts and a Silver Star for combat operations in Vietnam.  
This dude was very crazy and it was cool to hang out with him sometimes because he always had great smoke. When he told some of his Nam stories to us, it made me want to emulate him and be just like him, a guy with a tough reputation and a someone everyone knew had balls.   
Everybody who knew him, knew he was a badass. Right off the bat I wanted to be just like him, having that character that would never take shit from anybody, to have that street cred. 
His stories filled me up with much bravado and would influence how I carried myself and act just a little bit crazier, making guys scared to fuck with me.  
Thinking back, I think my dad gave me quite a bit of this too as well, dad always demanded respect from others and if he perceived he didn’t receive it, he would go bonkers, hence the ass kicking he gave to the Archbishop Humberto Sousa Medeiros years earlier. 
Catholic Memorial was good for me to some degree. I actually received quite a good education while I was there, all while still pulling crap like lighting up joints in the back of typing and geometry classes. One day in geometry class sitting next to my JV quarterback Wally McDonough, I decided to pull out a roach of Columbian gold and light it up.  
I asked Wally if he wanted a hit but he laughed and refused. So, sitting in my desk those single unit desks with the desktop and chair attached together, I leaned up against the wall where I decided to light up the roach and smoke it while the Catholic Brother was at the chock board explaining some Geometric equations to us.  
The Brother who had just turned around decided to yell, “By God Cronin, if you don’t sit down in that dam chair and get off that wall, you are going to fall on your goddamn head!” 
Just as the smoke reached the front of the room my chair did slip and I did hit my head on the wall as he predicted God would do to me. At that exact same moment he screamed, “Who the hell is smoking that crap in here?” Nobody ratted me out, they didn’t dare!  
Jimmy O’Connor and I hung out quite a bit in our teens. I often brought him up to Maine with me. One time with Jimmy and Timmy, we went up with my dad in the winter to shovel the roof off at our summertime mobile home. 
Tim brought some LSD and a few hits of double barrel THC up with him. Jim and I took the THC and Timmy actually dropped both a hit of THC and a hit of LSD.  
All wasted for most of that day I remember exploring the frozen Muddy River, eventually ending up back up at camp where we decided to grab our toboggan and go behind the Sweetland’s cabin to coast down their back road which was a long and very steep icy mountain hill road.  
Our first few runs were amazing as we must have gotten our speeds up to 60 MPH. About our third run with Timmy in front as usual, we started down the steep icy hill road. 
As we flew down the steep grade again, Timmy with his legs crossed which meant his knees were hanging over the toboggan, hit a piece of frozen firewood that had iced itself to the surface of the steep decline. He hit it with such force; it drove Timmy right off the toboggan wiping all of us out.  
As Jim and I recovered from our wipeout we saw Timmy who was now limping around screaming holding his right knee in excruciating pain. Now very baked we approached Timmy somewhat cautiously after following a blood trail that led us still following him toward our camp. 
When we caught up to him, I saw his right pants torn at the knee and further looked at his wound and saw a huge chunk of meat hanging off it.  His kneecap was basically hanging off!
Oh god it was so fucking gross especially on THC! It grossed me out so bad and because I was so high, it made me puke. We made it back to camp and my dad wrapped Timmy’s knee so the blood would not get all over the car as we all drove with him to the Bridgton Hospital.  
Tim saw the doctor immediately and the doctor shot Timmy’s leg up with Novocain as he attempted to sew it back up. Tim was already tripping plus on THC and had said he felt the weirdest sensation from the mixture of drugs as the Novocain surged throughout his leg and he said he felt it going up his leg into his brain. 
Timmy blurted out “Wow” immediately following the shot. I think he got something like 15 stitches on his knee, which grounded us in the trailer the remainder of the night, with dad convinced we were all on drugs. But still played cards with us most of the night. 
Motley Hill was another place where we would toboggan. This hill went from a fairly steep decline to a very steep decline a quarter mile down it. It was lined with Japanese Cherry trees at the bottom of the hill. 
One winter night under a full moon we began the night chugging Southern Comfort and howling at the full moon in preparation for our kamikaze suicide mission.  
We started down the icy Arboretum hill where Timmy rather reminded me of a Japanese Bonsai Suicide Pilot as he once again took the drivers position heading down what we referred to as our suicide mission.  
We flew down the hill toward the bottom as Timmy screamed lean left, lean left! We all leaned left, but to no avail as the bottom of the hill was 3” of thick ice. Timmy hit a four-inch branch from the Japanese Cherry Tree and was immediately knocked out.  
I forget who was with me that night other than Timmy, but I remember loading him back up onto the toboggan and pulling him all the way home back home. 
Still being very inebriated from the Southern Comfort we drank, we decided to leave Tim on the toboggan and knocked on my front door running away before someone in my house answered. 
Feeling sorry to have thrown Timmy under the bus like that, I realized I had no choice unless I was going to confront my dad and get caught drinking again.  
My cellar at home was furnished with a pool table and it doubled as a ping pong table. I learned how to play pool on it as a kid and got really good my whole life! 
One time however, Tim and I had 3 other guys with us in the cellar and we decided to get stoned in the bathroom. We smoked some hash and as we were almost finished, we heard a knock on the door and Timmy in a high-pitched squeal said, “who is it?”
It was dad and he said in a pissed off voice, “who the hell is in there?” We said in unison, “oh shit” and we opened the door and Tim pushed out our three friends first and Tim and I last. But as we walked by Freddy (Dad) he slammed our heads together and we stammered out of the basement running for our lives. Sorry Dad!
So, one time Dad took Tim and I to church and sat between us to keep us 2 idiots from causing trouble. 
If it wasn’t for Timmy wearing that stupid fur collared hat on, I’ have been just fine! 
So, Timmy sat there looking all sorts of stupid with his stupid furry hat on and it was kind of pissing me off!
I decided to reach behind my father and push Tim’s hat down over his eyes. By the third time doing this, he reached around my father and cracked me in the mouth!
Fuck, Dad had had it! He grabbed us both up by the collar’s and yanked us out of our seats into the isle, screaming, I’m going to fucking kill you two! This was proceeded to him slamming our heads together!  Slam, that fucking hurt!
Our friends’ older brothers were big-time dealers mainly of marijuana, but occasionally they had other drugs too! One summer we had opium and got high daily on it up the arbs! It was a fun high, and made everything really funny and mellow. 
We got high almost one whole summer with it but all of a sudden, our supply was gone! Withdrawals out the ying-yang and they were not too fun either. We got over this by smoking weed daily and drinking for me on the weekends. We were freakin party animals back then!                        

                       Goonoo Bruno
Michael Bruno was an older guy with a car that we used for rides often, but primarily we let him hang out with us because he would buy weed from John and he would smoke it all with us after. We smoked a ton of Bruno’s weed with him, and it was always very good strong pot too.
Mike was basically a pussy. Everyone took advantage of him which sometimes resulted in guys beating him up and bullying him. I took it upon myself to defend him sometimes, even though I messed with him the most in our group. 
Michael appreciated the fact that nobody would mess with him when he was with us. One day we were out of weed and we conned Michael into going inside his house to get some cash. It was a raw foggy afternoon as we sat on the corner convincing him to get money.  
His neighbors just pulled into their driveway and began unloading their groceries to their home. A box had fallen onto the ground, so I curiously went over to see what it was. It turned out to be a new box of Kotex pads. Being a punk, I thought it would be funny to pull a prank on Mike.  
Mike was such a goon! We called him Goono Bruno for a reason and kept everyone else from fucking with him. Well unbeknownst to Ogg and John, I ripped the box open and grabbed a pad, taking the glue strip protective paper off it. Mike by then was wearing down from our continued demands to get cash for us to buy weed again.  
I came up to him and said, “Go in the damn house and get us cash please!” Well at that point, he finally agreed and started for his front door. I put my arm around him, patted his back saying, “you’re a good dude Mike.” As I patted his back, I attached the pad as he walked into his house now wearing the Kotex rag on his back.  
John and Ogg started laughing so hard! John said, “Yule you’re so fucking mean, you’re a dick!” Michael must have been in for about five minutes when he came out of his front door with his dad grabbing and pulling him toward us by his ear, now screaming at all of us.  
His father spun him Mike around with him still wearing the rag on his back, as all three of us were on the ground laughing hysterically. His dad began screaming, “You guys are gonna get it! My other son is a black belt and he’s going to kick all your asses!”  
We were all in a full-blown hysterics laughing fit. His father who continued to yell at us, sounded like he was screaming foof, foof, foof.  
OMG if I wasn’t going to hell for this, I don’t know what it would take to get me sentenced there. Ogg of course later named Bruno’s father foof-foof as we retold our story many times to others. 
On another Bruno adventure, we bribed Mike by giving him some weed and hired him as our driver for the day. He happily agreed to it, even though we told him the four of us were dropping some acid. John’s bright idea was for us to drive downtown to the Science Museum.  
As we arrived and being the fourth guy inline as we approached the science museum ticket counter line, I noticed at that moment, that I was beginning to trip. 
John and Ogg suddenly leapt over the turnstile leaving a scared and confused Bruno in front of me. I screamed at him to move his ass and we both jumped the turnstile too.  
We all ran into the museum with a security guard in hot pursuit of us. Since we all ran in different directions, I decided to hide in this huge 15’ tractor tire exhibit and climbed inside the tire where I hid for about five minutes. 
I heard a guard talk on the walkie-talkie and said he was continuing his search further down the south-east corridor of the museum.  
A minute later I climbed out of the tire and went into another section looking for my friends. I searched for them and I thought I heard the security guard coming again, so I ran off and went into another exhibit room down this corridor in the museum. 
As I leaned on the wall, I started or so I thought I started having auditory hallucinations. I could actually hear my heart beating as I leaned against this one wall. 
I thought I was having an out-of-body tripping experience when Ogg came from around the corner and looked at me, as I was frozen against the wall pale faced, now tripping balls.  
He laughed and asked me what was wrong with me since I looked so scared and I told him, “God I’m so fucked up, I can hear my own heartbeat.” He looked at me and how serious I was and started laughing at me again hysterically.  
We then followed a winding tunnel around a turn where there were exhibits on the wall of different types of drugs behind a Plexiglas protective wall. As I pushed a button on the drug exhibit, a heartbeat would begin beating louder and louder to imitate what a heart would sound like on that particular drug.  
All of us got a laugh at the idea that I thought I was hearing my own heartbeat. I was relieved to realize it wasn’t me and I laughed along too.  
One Friday night I was hanging down the square away from my friends when I saw Michael across the street. I approached him and noticed someone had given him a black eye. 
Without any hesitation I asked him who did it. He told me someone he knew stole his weed from him and he tried getting it back but the dude smacked him. I told Mike we would get his weed back and asked him where this guy was.  
At first, he said for me not to bother, but I insisted and convinced him this dude had to pay. I knew if I did not stop it now, it would just escalate and become a reoccurring scene Mike would face and although we fucked with him a lot, I still liked Mike enough to stop anyone else from messing with him. 
We walked back up to the arbs where we saw this kid with his friends and I noticed there were five of them getting high with Mike’s weed.  
I walked up to the kid who punched Mike and I asked him if he thought he was tough. He said in a not so certain tone of voice that he thought he was. I gave him one chance by asking him nicely if he’d give Mike back his weed, but he replied no fucking way. 
So, I just punched him really hard in the stomach and watched him fall to his knees completely out of breath gasping for air.  
He began squealing at me that he was sorry, so I just said, “Tell Mike you’re sorry and give him back his fucking weed.” He apologized to Mike, then after he got to his feet, he handed him back his pot.  
The five of them had heard I was pretty nuts with a crazy reputation and decided they would not even try messing with me. 
They had heard of me and knew who my friends were and none of them tried jumping me because they knew my friends and I would beat their asses. I told all five of them that if any one of them screwed with Mike again, they would have to deal with me.  
Nobody there that day ever messed with Mike again. I myself was pretty mean to him though, but I kept everyone else from screwing with him from then on. Although I was probably Mike’s biggest nemesis, he was somewhat thankful that I kept everyone else from messing with him.  
Another time with Ogg and Bruno we decided to go cruising smoking some pot. Mike was driving and he started giving me some shit trying to act tough in front of Ogg for whatever reason. I was sitting behind him, so I wanted to bust his balls and see if I could get him to drive with me covering his eyes as I barked out directions, such as steer right or steer left.  
According to Ogg however, that night also involved us getting John who was bringing 2 ounces of pharmaceutical coke over to Patrick’s. Either I was too stoned from smoking or I just didn’t care, I decided to fuck with Bruno since he started kind of zooing on me along with John and Ogg.  
Ogg was sitting in the front seat as Bruno drove and I guess John was sitting next to me and I leapt onto the back of the front seat, holding Bruno’s eyes shut, barking out orders for Mike to steer left or right. 
Ogg screamed fucking Yule as he pushed me off him, yelling at me to stop. I jumped almost into the front seat, as Ogg and I began kind of fighting, while Bruno started fucking whining like a little bitch.   
I was very baked and didn’t realize we had coke on us. I don’t remember John, but maybe we just dropped him off downtown at Patrick’s condo. In any case Ogg was very pissed at me that night. 
Getting back to Rossie, Ogg had enough, so we dropped him off at home and Bruno and I drove off into the night. We headed up toward White Stadium. 
I took over the driving at that point, even though I did not have a license. We drove behind White Stadium and went down this tarred path where we came upon about ten black dudes partying around a campfire. 
We were too deep down the narrow path in the woods and had no way of turning around. So, I decided to just punch it and drove Mike’s car right over and through the camp fire as those black guys all jumped into the bushes to save their own lives. 
Michael screamed, “Yule, you crazy fuck” and we drove right over the four-foot flame not hesitating for one second. We hit something and blew out a tire, but there was no way I was going to stop, so I just kept driving until we got about a half a mile away in relative safety.  
So, as I mentioned before, Mike from time to time would try to look tough in front of John and Ogg and he tried giving me shit. Well, I decided to use Mike as a tackling dummy one night, as I made Mike stand there and I would just tackle the shit out of him. I asked him if he still thought he was tough, and he definitely said yes.  
Huh, damn boy did have balls. I even grabbed him by the ankles and dragged him through a pile of dog shit on the church lawn where we were one night. 
He screamed at me to stop, which I did and he never tried to zoo on me ever again. Messing with Mike probably gave me bad future karma, which I paid for in spades later in life!  
CM was fun; I now wish I had pushed myself to study harder when I was there, but I was really just a fuck-up back then. 
Michael my oldest brother elected to take the task of occasionally watching me after school when I was a sophomore and I would commute to the Murphy School in Dorchester to hang out, working out lifting weights in their gym. Dan Burke also had a side gig over at the Murphy school, but was primarily the JV football coach at CM. 
My brother also ran the YES program in Boston and took inner city youths up-country to snow-ski or kayak in the summer. Mike was a great influence in my life, which gave me a much-needed break from hanging out with my Rossie buds at home.  
Once I overheard this kid call Michael a fag, and yes Michael was gay, but no one was going to fuck with my oldest brother at all, especially in front of me. 
So, I grabbed this punk and whipped him into a glass door, pushing him through the now closed door, throwing him on the ground. He never opened his mouth ever again, as he became pretty petrified of me. 
One day after CM JV football practice, I decided to play a pick-up game of football behind an eight-foot fenced in beautiful elite rich private school field at Roxbury Latin over in West Roxbury, but that day I unfortunately tore every ligament in my right ankle.  
It was so bad, my ankle swelled up and I had to loosen up my sneaker laces because of the intense pain. When I did, the swelling exploded into an ugly swollen pumpkin. I remember limping to where this eight-foot fence was and tried to climb over it with my messed-up ankle.  
Climbing up was not so bad but landing on the ground partially on that ankle killed. Dr. McDonough our family physician diagnosed my ankle saying I tore all my ligaments and tendons completely.  
Back then orthopedic surgery was in its infancy, so no surgery was recommended. This would mean the end of CM football days.  
Tommy Heinson, the famous Celtic player and Celtic Head coach had his son on our team. When this 6’-7” kid saw me the next morning in class on crutches, he started immediately zooing on me, calling me a pussy.  
Fuck him I thought, so I dropped my crutches and leapt at him trying to punch him but everyone there interceded by breaking it up, probably saved me from getting my ass kicked, but at least I showed him I wasn’t a pussy!  
The next day now on Percocet with my ankle wrapped up, crutches by my side and in my living room, blasting “Machine Gun,” a great hardcore Hendrix song, Ogg began strumming the strings of our Baby Grand Piano with a joint hanging out of his mouth as my mother walked into the living room and she shrieked, “Turn off that fucking shit now!”  
Then she focused on Ogg, who was still strumming the damn piano and screamed, “Ogg get the fuck out of here now!” He cuffed his joint and squeezed by my mother cautiously, kind of laughing, while she stood there herself kind of in shock ready to smack him. 
 The next day when Ogg and John called me at my house, Ogg came up with a nickname for my mother. It was “Attila.” They got a huge laugh out of it and teased me relentlessly which was always at my expense. 
Well as it happened later that same year, Brother Donohue, a new younger brother decided to smack me in the mouth for talking during of all things, CCD class. 
He threw me out in the hall and I stood there for a second, now fuming. I then remember looking back in class, as Wally McDonough was gesturing behind Donohue’s back for me to hit him back.  
I tried to get a shot in but he blocked it as my x-football coach Dan Burke came out in the hallway behind me to aid brother Donahue, who then preceded to throw me up against the lockers.   
Well, soon thereafter they called my dad of course and he decided to offer me an out. He asked me if I wanted to change schools and go to a Boston Public School called Another Course to College.
This school took kids from all over the city which was located near the Boston Commons, a school that affiliated itself with the U-Mass Boston campus and taught college level courses.  
He sold me on the idea, telling me there were also girls at this school too. The thought of that whole scenario brought about a huge smile to my face. Also, another thought raced into my head all of a sudden.  
I always wanted to play football at White Stadium, the biggest high school football stadium in the country which my father ran. 
He actually grew the grass there that year in which I eventually played on. His job was the Assistant Athletic Director for the Boston School Committee and I wanted so bad to be his only son to play ball there.  
A lifelong dream was now going to be a reality. I wanted so bad to make my father proud and deep down inside I knew I eventually would! 
Leaving CM behind for me was somewhat sad. I also felt kind of like a looser, that I could not hack the discipline needed to handle the Catholic Brothers. I also had a ton of friends that I spent 2.5 years with there.  
While there, I was hanging with both jocks and veges, (guys who were potheads and partiers). I played football for CM, regarded as one of the best teams in the hardest division in our state.  
When I went out for the team, I was 16 years old, 155 lbs. soaking wet guy, but was quick and had good hands as a receiver. Our school went through a two-week football camp where we did two a day workouts the entire time. 
We ate great food at camp too and I remember having a good time there. That year the Varsity won state and hoisted yet another trophy to be put in the over flowing trophy case.  
I had practiced hard and worked myself into great shape while I was there. I began lifting weights and running during these first days of school sports at CM and it began to show dividends. 
I also started to gain a reputation as a tough kid back home in Roslindale. I was especially hungry to be a good football player since my dad ran the athletic department for all of Boston Public Schools. In the back of my mind, I knew I wanted to play there, being the only kid in our family to play in front of him.  
So, going to my new school meant for me, to be riding the Orange line downtown, passing some of the most economically distressed areas of the inner city. 
We passed Green Street and Eggleston stations where White Stadium was located way up on the hill by Franklin Park Zoo. Next stop on this route was Dudley, the stop where Madison Park High School was located.  
Dudley was my assigned area school because of bussing, if I decided to play high school sports; I had to play here near the projects with the majority of kids who were black city youths, which eventually became my teammates in track and football.  
Going to ACC, (Another Course to College) meant that I would be commuting downtown right at the Boston Commons, up on Beacon Hill, less than a mile from the gold domed Massachusetts Capital building. 
I would join a select crop of kids from different parts of the city, including Southie, Eastie, West Roxbury, the North End, Roslindale, Dorchester, Hyde Park and Jamaica Plane and Roxbury. 
We had a college curriculum meant to prepare us for college after we were to graduate from ACC. Affiliated with UMass Boston, we had to commute to U-Mass Boston Campus in the afternoon and take college math and English courses to prepare us for college. 
This school granted us a level of freedom I soon took advantage of, enabling us to leave campus whenever we pleased and I abused the privilege immediately by smoking pot too. 
First off, there were now girls in my school, a setting that I had not been in since being in junior high back in Roslindale. 
I awkwardly communicated with these girls because I was shy, not use to being with them and occasionally high on pot. Although I found it difficult; however, I still really wanted to fit in and have a cute girlfriend.  
Thinking back to this time I felt such a strange sense of depression, which I could not understand. Partially it was because I had terrible social skills, a horrible self-esteem and I think what a huge factor was also, was I turned 17 years old the prior summer and I began feeling the beginnings of what I later had been diagnosed with of having, schizoaffective disorder.  
So, looking back now, I can definitely see the correlation to me doing drugs and drinking and performing a sort of self-medication, to counteract the sensations of having a schizoaffective disorder, which dominated my life back then! 
I could hear voices as some kind of auditory hallucinations which clearly were the start of having a telepathic ability mixed in with paranoid ideations that confused me to the core. No wonder I used drugs and alcohol to escape reality!
I could not figure out why I openly looked so depressed as well! Kids would often ask me why I looked so down, and I couldn’t think of a good response. 
I for no reason, felt like an outcast. To me I thought everyone knew there was something wrong with me!   
I concocted what I thought was a reasonable excuse as to why I seemed so sad and that was a cover story I had made up that my oldest brother had died in Vietnam. 
I made the mistake of telling someone this justification of my depressed state of mind but did not realize it would take on a life of its own.  
I thought in my weird state of mind, kids would accept my appearance of looking depressed, having that bizarre backstory. Therefore, I began living a lie for a while as I began this new school. 
Eventually feeling very conflicted; I realized I wished I never opened my mouth up at all. Especially since there was someone in my school who was a third cousin, who spread around to people that I had made up the whole story.  
I to some degree had now become a pariah to the student body. A self-inflicted wound that I visited upon myself solely for the purpose of fitting in. Boy did that backfire!  

Outward Bound
The summer finally came and now prompted by Michael; I was convinced to go on a month-long sailing camp called Outward Bound. This was a Youth Enrichment Service’s (YES) program that Michael was involved with where he got me a free scholarship to. 
This camp pitted inner city youths up weirdly with middle-class struggling executives in a character-building course meant to build confidence and self-esteem. It also gave me the much-needed break away from my party-happy friends back at home in Boston.  
We left on Friday morning and endured a four-hour bus ride where I witnessed firsthand an accident which claimed the life of the Jeep’s passenger that involved this jeep and an SUV. 
I saw the passenger of the Jeep go through the windshield as I awoke from my slumber on the back of our bus as I heard the sound of screeching brakes, followed by witnessing this guy die. 
Later we arrived at our port destination of Rockland Maine where we would assemble and eventually meet with our new crewmates. Our crew was a combination of 17-year old’s and about six older adults, two of which were crew leaders. 
I was somewhat dismayed by the fact that I would miss the YES concert back at Boston Garden that evening. As we boarded a 22’ long rowboat sailboat, Margret, a hot big-38 double D big breasted 36-year-old blue-eyed blonde-haired hottie told us to row.  
I sat there and began to row with three others in a team effort to pull ourselves out of the harbor. The wind had somewhat subsided, so our rowing power was needed to get us moving.  
As I distinctly remember starting to row, thinking how I would be missing my Yes concert that evening that I had tickets to, when Margret the team leader decided to strip her top off unceremoniously in the late June hot sun.  
Holy shit, damn did she have big nice tits. I sort of stood up for a brief moment to look at Margret’s beautiful D-breasts, when she assured me, this was all natural, that this was how life was meant to be. 
Ok, color me stupid right, but this day and age, she may even be considered some kind of weird pedophile for popping those beautiful girls out in front of a horny 17-year-old man like myself, but hey I wasn’t complaining.  
Her pretty smile and soft skin assured me however, this month-long Outward-Bound camp course would be freaking awesome, fuck the Yes concert I thought! 
Now under wind power beyond the safety of the calm sheltered harbor waters, we sailed right through sunset and eventually anchored off a tiny secluded island where we slept onboard the boat on top of our oars, in sleeping bags, while two had anchor night watch. 
The first night, I scooped this 17-year-old chick under the stars during my first watch, which in retrospect was a blast.  
We eventually made it to Hurricane Island up in Nova Scotia with stops along the way where we would run a couple of miles almost every morning, with me doing pushups, which got me the name of Rocky. 
What seemed weird to me, especially even today, is we would skinny dip in the ocean after our long runs. So, a group of us, ages 16-36-year-olds would strip down to nothing and swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean.  Hum nothing can go wrong here, right?
Having fully purged myself from marijuana and its complementary element of THC, I started to feel so much healthier. However, one night, two weeks into our journey, this girl from an accompanying boat got ahold of some truly potent Hawaiian Marijuana. 
We smoked, and I got so stoned that afternoon, that I started remembering what I had seen earlier that day on one of our hikes we had.  
I saw this hot woman with a gorgeous body, naked and up on what really looked like to me to be some kind of weird hippy tree house. 
She was exquisite I remember, how her naked hot silhouette and uncaring naked demeanor to us approaching stood out most in my mind.
Thinking of her throughout the day on the tree platform and now hours later, stoned and walking toward this tree-hut to sleep in, while at that exact moment still baked, I wondered to myself if this would be the day and I’d have another life-changing adventure with this hot naked woman and officially lose my virginity! 
I could not help but fantasize that I would be able to go up in this tree house and have sex with this very hot woman. As I climbed the latter some 12’up in the air, I was full of anticipation of meeting her and thought about what I’d say to her. 
I climbed my way up a 12-foot latter then entered the tented doorway and was immediately saddened to see not one, but like six people in sleeping bags spread out all over the floor.   
I was not going to get laid that night, something I fantasized about most of my life; instead, I would now have to stifle this lustfulness I had and just pass out on the damn wooden floor. What a crappy disappointment that was!  
So, Outward Bound involved many things, first it was a sailing school where we sailed 300 miles and a rope course, rappelling down cliffs, a seven-mile race, and a three-day survival mission on a secluded island and of course most of which I did sober too. 
On this three-day survival mission, we were supplied with a sleeping bag, 12 stick matches, a 10’ by 10’ plastic tarp, a gallon of fresh water, a cooking pot, a couple of old canned sea-rations, and my hidden stash of TP to keep me from having to wipe with sea-weed.  
As I parted from the drop-off boat onto a rubber dingy, my team leader instructed me to stay away from the endangered bird species that were recently reintroduced back into the wild by some conservationist, which were Ospreys. She also imparted the knowledge that there were also two wild rams on the island as well.  
Dropped off on Little Spruce Island by the dingy, I immediately canvassed the area for a place to set up my lean-to. I picked what I thought was a nice spot, in a green grassy area that was soft enough to sleep on. 
My first night there it rained lightly, but by now I was used to outdoor living and stayed relatively warm and dry.  
The second day I gathered firewood and used the bark of a birch tree, peeling the bark back exposing the dry part of it to use as kindling; then lit a warm camp-fire.  
Later that day I decided to go exploring the island and went to the south side of the island to see that my island at low tide attached to another island. 
I decided to climb down some cliffs to the beach below and as I crossed a small beach which was loaded with tons of shells and round sea rocks, I headed towards the other island.  
I made my way on the other side of the beach, climbed back up the cliffs on the other island and explored most of the adjoining island to find another Outward-Bound survivalist hiding from the drizzle in his dry lean-to tent.  
We chatted for some time and I decided it was time to head back to my island since it was misting. Now getting dark, still misting and the tide was rising quickly almost covering up the connecting beach completely, I made my move to get back toward Little Spruce Island before the tide enveloped the beach. 
As I got onto the cliffs ready to descend back down to the beach, I came upon those two rams my leader warned me about as I left the drop-off boat. 
They were set up on the beach apparently now guarding my route back to my island. I thought for a minute and decided to bombard them with rocks, eventually forcing them off the beach.  
Thinking my efforts to drive the rams off the beach worked or so it appeared, so I began climbing down the cliffs heading to the other side, realizing that the rams that had hid behind the rock inlet, now had spotted me and began charging at me running full tilt in my direction.  
I hastily retreated and climbed up the steep cliff formation just managing to out climb those two pissed off rams. As I quickly ascended the wet cliff formation, I slipped and fell forward on my chest, causing me to crush my prescription bottle I had in my front shirt pocket which kept my 12 stick matches dry.  
Because of this, the matches were now completely wet and unusable. It looked as though I may have to go the rest of the weekend without a fire since the damn rain also extinguished the one I light earlier. 
I now was caught on the other island and it was almost dark out, raining and I just wanted to go back to my lean-to. So, I restarted my vicious rock assault and bombarded the helpless rams off the beach-head. They soon retreated to my side of the island where I nervously went in search of my campsite. 
As I returned to my campsite, I began to notice there were many ram pellets scattered all over the green grassy area where I had pitched my tent. Fearing rams in the middle of the night would visit me; I slept with one eye open the rest of the night.  
Next morning was gorgeous, the sun shone brightly, and I was trying to decide what I was going to eat. I unfortunately however, had destroyed my matches in my hasty escape from my two pissed off rams.  
After a half hour of just sitting there contemplating my next move, I noticed a young woman in a sailboat, sporting a bikini, sailing by me some 100’ offshore.  
I waved to her repeatedly and eventually she sailed close enough, so I could talk to her. I told her my story as she laughed offering to help by sailing to her camp, delivering some dry Ohio Tipp matches to me. That was truly a lucky prophecy! 
Later that afternoon I saw a bunch of lobster traps just offshore in the icy cold Atlantic Ocean. I decided to risk swimming out to the traps and dove down to see if there were any lobsters to be found in them. 
Even though the first trap was empty, I decided to go swim out even further in that icy cold Novia Scotia water and dove down a little deeper in an area that had several other traps there. Pay-day, this time I found two baby lobsters in this one trap. 
I had to swim further out when I found the two lobsters and the first time I dove, I had to retreat to get more air. 
On the second dive I first couldn’t see how to open the trap. So, I dove a third time, this time opening up the trap grabbing the two babies by their necks and I began swimming frantically to the surface, holding each lobster in either hand. 
Getting out of breath from doing the breaststroke while the lobsters were in each hand, I nervously kept swimming as one of them bit my hand. 
I got to shore heaving them up on the beach, immediately re-grabbing them before they scampered away, and I let out a victorious scream as I now would be dining on lobster that night.  
Until that moment in life, I had never eaten lobster. Weird, since I was from Boston originally and had frequented Maine practically my whole life at my parent’s summer home. 
Getting back up the cliffs to my campsite, I then decided to kill my lobsters so they would not scamper away, since I had to go back down to the ocean with my pot and get some ocean water to cook my seafood in.
I then built a fire and cooked my catch. While eating this meal, I remember thinking how this meal was one of the best meals I had ever eaten in my entire life. All I needed was some beer, a baked potato and some sour cream and butter!
After getting back to the drop-off boat which picked me up on day four, I listened to how the rest of my boat mates survived eating periwinkles and what not. I then regaled them of the tale of my lobster tail. 
Overall, a great experience and I needed a break from growing up in Roslindale and the havoc of busing in the late 70’s was going on. But you get things when you least expect it and my parents guided Michael into getting me the scholarship to this program. It helped as I went through a change and grew from this experience although my tougher years were yet to come!
