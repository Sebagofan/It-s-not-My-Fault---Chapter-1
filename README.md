# It-s-not-My-Fault---Author’s page:
Born in Boston as the fifth and last child in an Irish family in a predominately Irish-Italian neighborhood, I observed massive societal changes right in front of my eyes. 
Witnessing the end of the Cold War, the beginning of the Civil Rights movement, the start, and end of the Vietnam war leading to sex drugs and rock & roll revolution, and seeing first-hand assignations of key prominent leaders, our generation developed a more cynical view of the world and life overall.   
As I reached my teenage years, I was part of the beginning of the desegregation era in our public school system, which meant forced bussing in the early 70s. 
Our generation lived through a lot of turmoil and many families took sides, both pro and against the societal changes. America was at a crossroads! 
Having early symptoms of a Schizoaffective  disorder and not knowing how to deal with life while living symptoms with it, I turned to a process of self-medication. After extensive conflicts early on, I developed a hard outer shell for survival purposes where I felt a little more in control. 
As life progressed, I managed to not let life beat me down and benefitted by having an optimistic demeanor in spite of having deep depression which at times took total hold of me. I however always tried putting myself in the best possible position I could because of an inner desire to not settle for less. 
Having strong family influences both positive and negative became a blessing and a curse! My Dad used to say this about me, “Chris, you step in shit and come out smelling like a rose!” That could best sum up my life!


Chapter 1: The Early Days

Is it possible for a kid to go through a nervous breakdown at age 7? I actually think so, because I sense I did. There are some very personal things that I won’t discuss with you now, but know they had a profound effect on me which lasted a lifetime!	
2nd grade was a really tough year in my life!
Miss O’Leary known as one of the meanest teachers in our public school system just happened to find out that I was smoking cigarettes with some of the other guys. Consequently, she decided to hang me up on a coat hook like a slab of meat at a butcher’s shop for all my classmates to see.  
She kept me hanging there in the coat room for an hour or so to show everybody what happens to kids who disappoint her. Meanwhile, some of the other kids came into the coat room and began laughing at me which only made me lash out swinging and kicking wildly at them.  
That is not all, at the same time twice a week, I also had a CCD class with a second-grade catechism teacher who was named Sister Bennet. She was famous for dueling out a wicked punishment called the rat-tan. 
We considered this a medieval punishment that those nuns would use which amounted to them wailing on their knuckles with a wooden ruler causing extreme amounts of pain.  
She happily gave out this punishment way too often to misbehaving little Catholic boys like myself to keep us under her complete control. One day I tested her patients just one too many times!           
As a middle-class Boston Irish Catholic kid in second grade, I was expected to start Confession and receive Holy Communion that year. This did not go down as planned because of course I had to try sister Bennet and fool around in class. 
Much to my surprise, she was more than willing to meet out my punishment, “the rat-tan” on my knuckles as an example to everybody in the class as to how not to act. 
She grabbed my arm with one hand and swung that damn ruler on my knuckles with the other as hard as she could. The first whack fucking hurt! 
Well, the proverbial shit hit the fan! Before she swung twice, I jumped out of my seat, stood up, kicked her right in the shins, and made my escape out the front door. 
She did not bother to chase me because she was too busy rubbing her very sore shins. I eventually made my way home and much to my surprise, my parents had not even gotten a phone call from her. For some reason, Sister Bennet never bothered to call my home, lucky me, right? 
Weeks passed as I took it upon myself to hook Catechism class while hanging down Roslindale square,up on top of the roofs of all the businesses that occupied the square. I had a bird’s eye view of all the happenings in this pretty tough neighborhood. 
Cigarette smoking and hanging out with my brother and other buddies my age was of course what I did to kill the time I would ordinarily have spent in CCD class.  
Six weeks of doing this went by pretty quickly, when one day my father screamed at me from the living room for me to get my goddamn ass downstairs. 
He showed me the letter he received stating that because of my continued absence from CCD class, I would not be able to receive Holy Communion that year. 
Right then in there, he flipped out, chasing me out of the house trying to catch me to give me an ass kicking! 
Time went by that night and I got home to find my dad a little calmer, but that did not stop him from threatening me with eventual death if I ever hooked CCD class again. 
My dad and I now had to pay a visit with Sister Bennet and I was not looking forward to this scene whatsoever!
When we got there, the class had just started and Sister was in front of the whole class. She looked perturbed having to stop and take time from class to explain to my dad what happened, as he pleaded to Sister that if I didn’t get back into class his mom would kill the both of them! 
She shrieked, “There is nothing I can do about the situation,” he has missed too many classes and won’t be able to receive Holy Communion with his classmates!”  
Oh boy, you should have seen the look on dad’s face when all of a sudden, he just threw up his hands and yelled, “Fuck it, I don’t give a shit about the little bastard,” as he rushed out the door slamming it behind him leaving me standing there awkwardly in front of the completely stunned classroom full of petrified little second graders!
Sister Bennet at this point felt horrible about the scene dad caused and must have felt somewhat responsible because she hugged me seconds later and said, ”Poor boy, Poor boy, I’ll let you back in class and you can still receive Holy Communion with your classmates. Tell your father not to worry!” 
To this point in my life, this seemed to be a reoccurring theme of life events. I always found a way to get into trouble, but for some reason or another always managed somehow to get out of it. Either I had the luck of the Irish or had a very patient angel by my side!
A couple of months later, on the day of my Catechism ceremony, my friends and I broke into the O’Brien’s house with David O’Brien, who was their youngest son.  
His father used to lock him out of the house routinely because David could not be trusted alone in the house. True to form, we went in just to smoke the parliament cigarettes I had just lifted from my mother’s pocketbook. Mr. O’Brien came home unfortunately for me and caught us in the act. 
When I got home my dad must have received a phone call from Mr. O’Brien and he managed to find out about my misdeeds once again. He always had a weird eerie knack for always finding out the shit we got into. He must have had some type of inborn radar when it pertained to me and he always knew what I was up to. 
When I came in to get dressed for the Holy Communion Ceremony, he met me at the door with his belt in hand. 
My grandmother, who I never saw much of and did not even know that well, screamed at him to stop, saying, “Neil, you can’t punish him today, it’s his Holy Communion Day, a special day that should not be remembered for the punishment he got from his own father!”  
Dad looked at me and grumbled, “you lucky little bastard, today’s your lucky day!” Another magical moment in my life when I can look back and wonder, “How the hell did I get away with it again?”  
That fall I got into a lot of scrapes because of that personal thing that I won’t talk about and the older neighborhood kids thought they could intimidate me, but it always ended up with them yelling at me to calm the fuck down as I often scrapped with anyone who would fuck with me and I was often referred to as a crazy son-of-a-bitch! 
Street hockey and football were two sports where my brother and I excelled at and we kind of earned respect through our toughness, never backing down and always playing better than most guys our own age!
Life moved slowly and I dealt with Miss O’Leary and Sister Bennet and I somehow managed to escape into 3rd grade with my classmates. 
I went to confession reluctantly a few more times and did receive my Holy Communion with my class, but as far as CCD went, I knew I was never going back. That was kind of a done deal, the end of my Holy studies or at least until I was in high school at Catholic Memorial for a 2.5 year stint.  
Prior to these events were my dad’s insane behavioral acts which had a profound effect on my psyche. I wish I could blame it on the fact that he was a World War II veteran and in my life several times in the past I made up an excuse that my dad was a corpsman serving in battle with the marines, but this was a cover because the reality of it all was that he saw no action and I made excuses as to why he was so crazy. Why else would he act so insane, right?
Was it because one day when he came home from lunch, mom was on top of the outside of the sleeping bag which was zippered all the way up and had the milk-man was stuck inside it?      
According to her, she was trying to undo the zipper and free our milkman, Dick Boylan from the confines of an Alaskan sleeping bag that he wanted to borrow on a camping trip. Mom was just showing him how warm it was, or that was the excuse she used anyways!
He would pace the hallway unable to sleep at night, in a rage punching the wall and screaming randomly, even at Girt Nolan to go fuck herself, our saintly neighbor who was probably unaware of the verbal assault hurled her way for no particular reason.
Looking back at it now, I see the manic side of my dad way back then but unfortunately for me, things with him declined much worse, but coincidentally when I got older the fidelity mantra became a whole big thing for me too!
When I was about 25, right back from New York just a few years earlier with all the trauma I endured there. I began working track meets with my dad and there was a lady who worked there who had eyes on him and all I could imagine was him doing her too!
All of a sudden, I incoherently blurted out something to my father put him in a headlock, and ran him up six stairs, then pulled him down the same six stairs with him basically probably wondering what the fuck! 
The initial meds the VA had me on to help with paranoia only made shit way worse and I imagined dad cheating on my mom which infuriated me so fucking much!
Mom screamed Chrissy stop, what the hell are you doing? I released my 57-year-old shocked father and you could tell that I hurt his feelings. Whatever I was dreaming up in my mind wasn’t real whatsoever and after I accused him of cheating on mom with that lady, my mom burst out laughing! 
What a weird moment, mom deflated a potentially dangerous moment by explaining, dad would never cheat on her with that woman, she was too damn ugly, and that it was all in my head! 
Embarrassed as I was, I made a heartfelt apology to dad and he just hugged me and told me he loved me and that I’d be alright! 
He previously, however, had a lot of negative influences on me because of some of his insane, crazy antics he pulled in our house when I was 5 years old.
But years later inundated me with some deep devotion that he showered on a son; that in all probability, reminded him to be a bit of himself! Unfortunately, a lot of his early antics would inevitably scar me for most of my teenage and adult life. 
My mom and dad married each other back in the day when couples stayed married for life, as they had done. I realize now I think dad was bipolar, which would explain much of the way he sometimes acted, and not to forget to mention how all of us kids to some degree received his tendencies to be a little bipolar as well.  
I really remember a couple of incidents clearly even today when I was five years old that he did, which messed me up for many years. 
This one summer mostly with the windows all up to capture the summer breeze, my dad and mom had a lot of screaming matches in our home that echoed throughout this very close-knit neighborhood. It often escalated by dad throwing and breaking things, and his anger came out in a threatening controlling violence. 
Two nights in particular, I remember; dad went on a real tear and scared the shit out of us. One terrible night I vividly remember mom and dad fighting hard. I did not know why they were screaming at each other; I only knew it was especially intense that evening and I feared this would be a lot worse than usual.  
At first, I thought I would just be running downstairs to referee a loud screaming match but then ended up trying to wrestle a knife out of dad’s hand. He had taken a kitchen knife from the kitchen drawer and put it to his throat and screamed, “Fuck it, I’ll kill myself then!”  
I found myself in uncharted waters and it was either Timmy or Katie, along with my mother and I who began to wrestle the knife out of his hands. We still witnessed him cutting his throat deep enough to cause blood to spurt out all over the place. 
As we tried to prevent him from continuing in his efforts he knocked me to the floor, we all kept trying to disarm him, keeping him from doing any more damage!  
The sinking feeling in my heart from this was profound! At around five years old I was trying to figure out why the man I loved so much, who had a huge part in raising us, handled anger and grief by acting out in this way. I think this was his way of sowing deep fear in us all.   
Another night month’s later dad did about the same thing again, but this time taking a whole bottle of valiums and chasing them by downing a quart of whiskey as we tried in vain to intervene again, without any effect!  
What I now know, is that he used fear and intimidation as some type of method to control my mother. What I; until now did not realize was that to some degree I tried to emulate him later in life when I was in my own unhealthy relationships.  
Probably considered today as a form of “domestic abuse,” those events if repeated these days would make people today grimace at such behavior and how my mother managed, I’ll never know. 
That kind of behavior might even lead to police action with family court involving interventions with therapists, which may have been thrust upon us if this happened now. Which in actuality may have been helpful!
The horror of those nights haunted me long into the future. Little did I know his actions would have a profound effect on me many years later!  
The holidays always affected him the most for some reason. One time he took the decorated Christmas tree and threw it out the front door into the slushy winter snow, proclaiming he hated Christmas. 
I think it was the whole commercialization of Christmas instead of the celebration it was intended for, which was the birth of Jesus Christ!
At one point in his life, he considered becoming a priest. Wow, go figure!
Another night I remember, he took the Thanksgiving Day turkey and screamed, “there won’t be a fucking Thanksgiving,” then proceeded to throw the bird out in the backyard into the freshly fallen snow.  
My mom defiantly went outside and took the turkey into the house and cleaned it up and served it to the rest of us, while he stormed off upstairs to bed. Just another typical holiday at the Cronin house! 
I remember my dad one time getting into serious trouble at White Stadium where he worked as the Assistant Athletic Director in the Boston Public School System. 
One day during Special Olympics sporting event at White Stadium in July, he really got himself into a jam, that in retrospect I can look back and think to myself just how fucking crazy he really was!
This one summer day it sweltering 94 degree heat during a Special Olympics track meet. Because it was so hot my dad instructed the kids to go and sit under a shady oak tree where he provided paper cups and a 5-gallon cooler with iced water for the young special athletes. 
Well, you will never guess who attended the stadium that day. It was His Eminence, Humberto Sousa Medeiros, the Archbishop of Boston representing the Catholic Church with all its pomp and celebrity.  
The archbishop who I guess thought he was always in control took it upon himself to walk over and tell the kids to move out from underneath the tree so the ambulance could now park there to get out of the hot sun.  
Dad saw the kids now leaving from underneath the shady tree and back into the hot sun as the ambulance moved under the comfort of the shady tree. 
He immediately approached the driver and asked him to move again as His Eminence listened on just feet away. 
The archbishop fatefuly approached my dad scolding him loudly saying, “Mind your business, who do you think you are?” 
Oh boy, you would not believe what happened next?   
Dad screamed “Fuck you, asshole” and began punching the archbishop tackling him to the ground, all while his eminence was decked out wearing those full ceremonial robes including that weird strange black hat that they wore which made it look much more of a spectacle.  
Quickly the police escort who were supposed to be guarding his Eminence all converged on my dad; which in actuality, took all four officers to pry him off the now very shocked Holy Man. 
Dad got an unexpected invite in handcuffs down to precinct 13, a police station near the stadium where he knew most of the officers anyways. He sat in a dank private cell for a few days!
A couple of days later they escorted him to the VA mental ward and he stayed there for a month to treat his nutty behavior.  
I remember going to visit him at the VA hospital with Timmy and he gave me a wallet he made during an arts and crafts therapy session. Boy was he three sheets to the wind! They had him stoned on something, probably Thorazine. Wow, this was too surreal; dad was locked up because he was dangerous, go figure right!?
That summer apparently when dad recovered enough, we started camping all over when I was about six years old. I remember camping down at Cape Cod, and going to Vermont, New Hampshire, and all throughout Maine. Camping in the summer meant leaving the hustle and bustle of our beloved congested city of Boston.  
I had so many childhood memories camping all over New England. One time camping down in Cape Cod as dad was fishing in the canal. Timmy fell into the very strong Cape Cod Canal and the current swept him away. 
Michael who just became a lifeguard at the YMCA, jumped into the canal, swam after him despite the almost overbearing current, and rescued him from a probable drowning.  
So, I used to hang out with dad at White Stadium when I was about 7 in the summer. One particular day I went looking for him because Frank McCormick asked me to find dad and have him move his truck.
Well, when I approached his office, I heard behind closed doors some woman giggling in his office! This room conveniently had a bed-cot with the first aid cabinet in it where the nurse handily shared a room with my dad. 
When I knocked on the door, they all of a sudden became really quiet. Then I persisted in knocking loudly again this time yelling Dad I know you’re in there. Boy, what a pain in the ass that must have been!
Dad said, “Go away Chris I’m busy right now!” So, I just forgot my assignment and left, a little disturbed he was in there with the nurse giggling though!
Well, when I got home, I went right in and told my mom dad had me locked out of his office he and the nurse were in there giggling and he told me to leave because he was too busy!
Oh shit, did that start a fucking war! Mom had the fridge open as I told her this and she began whipping everything inside the fridge at him including cans, jars, and eggs. He was basically screwed! 
After the melee was over and in front of my dad. My mother told my dad he would be taking me to work every day that summer and that I was to keep an eye on him. Mind you I was only 7 years old.
The ride to work the next day was quiet, except for the part that day he called me a rat fink! But sorry, dad, (!) that’s my mom's buddy and I think he understood after all even back then although I adored him, I loved her too! 
Did I then pick up the lifelong trait of putting fidelity as being something extremely important, something I would obsess about to the extreme later in life to the point where it was debilitating? Maybe!
I can tell dad stories forever since he was a character like me. But there was one thing about my father that I can tell you now, he was extremely defensive when it came to his family!  
When I was at White Stadium that summer there was this incident where the sporting goods supply room at the stadium got broken into by some of dad’s workers. 
You see, at White Stadium, we held onto all the sporting equipment that would be delivered to all the Boston Public Schools! 
One day, there was this one worker who witnessed the break-in and he left a note on my dad’s desk ratting on the workers who broke into the storage room.
Dad I remember, played it cool and said he got a ride home from one of the suspects because coincidently that afternoon I lost his keys playing toss in the air with them as I threw it up in the air, I lost it in the sun and just went about my business forgetting I just lost dad’s keys!
Dad however, knew this guy had the stuff in his trunk and somehow got the guy to open it for him and busted him right there and then in front of me.
Well as pissed as he was, dad reported this one guy who was also a tenured teacher who we found out lost both jobs eventually once the superintendent of the schools found out about it. So needless to say, this guy was totally pissed! 
Here’s the thing. This guy thought I was the rat who finked on him and as dad and I were walking by him at lunch the day after, he threatened to slap the shit out of me!
Dad calmly walked over to him, then abruptly screamed “what mother fucker” and began hammering this piece of shit in the head with right hooks as he fell to the ground. Don’t ever threaten my son you bastard he screamed as he finished beating this guy.
The truth came out and the real rat was found out. It was this real skinny worker kid, whom they stripped naked and taped his hands and ankles together and left him there on the ground as dad and I got back into the stadium from lunch. Dad just handed me a knife and said “cut him loose!”

Another time I think around 1967 in New Hampshire, we went camping up in the White Mountains near Pinkham’s Notch. 
On this particular night; which happened to be my birthday on July 31, we were camping celebrating my birthday having cake and ice cream. Strangely enough, another family we noticed with a much bigger group were also having a birthday celebration just two campsites over from ours!
Their crowd was rather large as they surrounded a beautiful blazing campfire while they all sang happy birthday to the young boy who was around my age.   
It seemed to be getting late as I snuggled in a heavy woolen blanket on a cot with my family, as we were just finishing our celebration. 
There was an older woman over at the other party who grabbed some charcoal lighter fluid and began squirting it into the roaring fire, instantly making a loud boom as the lighter fluid hit the flame.  
What happened next, I’ll never forget! As she continued squeezing the lighter fluid can into the fire, the flames vaulted 12 feet into the air, but as she released her squeeze and the can began sucking the air back in, the flames which were now high as hell, followed the vapor trail back up into the can, exploding it instantly!  
I heard two booms that night. The first was when the fuel had initially hit the flames of the fire, which drew my attention; then a few seconds later was the second explosion as fire vaulted into the lighter fluid can following the vapor trail back to the can, exploding the 28 once container like a bomb! 
The explosion of the can completely left the elderly woman engulfed in fire! She immediately began running and I watched her viciously screaming in what I imagined was excruciating unimaginable pain.  
As she ran around the campsite now completely consumed by fire, trails of flames fell off her igniting the woods around the campsite as she ran. 
I’ll never forget how she resembled a human torch after the explosions, which were followed by the haunting extreme frantic screams which have stayed with me all these years later! 
Considering I was only eight years old when the event happened, it did not scare me all that much. My dad’s immediate reaction to seeing her running as a human torch was rather heroic though! 
He grabbed the blanket I had wrapped myself up in and charged toward the chaotic scene. As she was still both running around now completely enveloped by fire, the scene of him tackling the burning woman to the ground probably seared the memory into my brain for life!  
Right after he tackled her, he began rolling her in the blanket repeatedly rolling her over and over to extinguish her flames. She had third and fourth-degree burns on almost 80% of her body. 
The full-thickness of third-degree burns had spread throughout her whole body, extending to most of her upper torso and to all the layers of her face.  
Some fourth-degree burns additionally covered her neck and face involving a deeper injury to tissues including the face muscles, tendons, and even her eyes. Her hair and most of her clothes completely burnt off; filling the air with a disgusting burnt stench I can still recall all these years later!
The next morning was unnervingly silent, until my brother Neil told me the woman died as he started playing the Beatles song “Eleanor Rigby" written by Paul McCartney. 
It was one of the most surreal moments that early morning capsulizing the previous night’s events as I reflected on the horror, while now listening to the eeriness of the music and its equally disturbing lyrics. 
  
 "Eleanor Rigby"
Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 
 Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
 Lives in a dream
 Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
 Who is it for?
 
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?
 
 Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
 No one comes near
 Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
 What does he care?
 
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 Where do they all belong?
 
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 Ah, look at all the lonely people
 
 Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
 Nobody came
 Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
 No one was saved
 
 All the lonely people
 (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
 Where do they all come from?
 All the lonely people
 (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
 Where do they all belong? 

 
 
As I stared into the foggy meadows now surrounded by the mist and fog obscuring half of the mountain we were camped up next to, while listening to the song Eleanor Rigby, it left such an indelible image of the woman’s horrible death and subsequent sad burial that the song lyrics now depicted, as I imagined it being this poor woman who was now dead! 
Not to be outdone, I remember on another birthday morning, wakening early and walking down the stairs from my bedroom and to see a weird scene. There was so much fog outside, you couldn’t see more than 10 feet in front of you. Never ever had I seen it so foggy like that before. 
This would be the second horrific event on my birthday as a jetliner crashed at Logan Airport. It was a Delta Air Lines DC-9 twin-engine jetliner Flight 723, which was operating as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Burlington, Vermont to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. 
On July 31, 1973, at 11:08 AM, while on an instrument approach into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the glide path, struck a seawall with its landing gear, and crashed, killing all but two of its 89 occupants.  
Both survivors later died of their injuries as they were both burned terribly. 
Extreme heavy fog was reportedly the reason for the crash leaving all dead but the two survivors, as one died that night, while the other, Leopold Chouinard, eventually succumb to his burn injuries on December 11, 1973. Six months of hell!
Besides these two events, for me, however, a late July birthday was always wicked cool. Celebrating in July sure beat celebrating in January like my brother Timmy had to do.
Even going out to a restaurant with my parents became a little bit hazardous back then. As one night, I can remember with just mom, dad, and myself at a restaurant, dad began seething that he was going to fucking kill someone. 
Out of the blue, dad hauls back and whips a bud bottle and hits this guy right in the head, leaps up, runs over and grabs him off the seat and throws him on the floor, and begins punching this guy in the head. 
The waitress screamed, and we heard someone else say, call the police. So, dad got all of us and we left immediately without even paying. He was truly nuts!
Second grade rolled into third and fourth and so on. By the sixth grade, many neighborhood kids including myself were doing stupid things, like drinking on the weekends, and even progressed into us sniffing glue as I think I sought to forget my childhood completely! 
During this period of time, we had rock fights and unfortunately for me, I got hit in the right eye and had a detached retina as a result.
Recently asked by a loved one, why we did those stupid things like drinking and drugs and I could only reply by saying, “I thought it was a combination of us trying to escape reality, possibly having alcoholic tendencies, and probable for me unknowingly doing a lot of self-medicating.”   
Years later, my diagnosis and subsequent advancing symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia materialized and became part of how my life which drastically changed with this onset, led to uncontrollable bouts of paranoia leading to me accusing girlfriends of infidelity in relationships while irrationally and constantly looking for evidence of this truth.  
A lot more regarding this truth had owned me for years and is discussed in detail later on. But first, look at the events that led up to this time, as my life by no means was a normal one.
During the early days in Sebago Lake State Park which were, however the most memorable in my youth, we continued enjoying the lake and having fun. 
My parents actually liked the area so much from camping up there, that they bought land in Naples, Maine which bordered Sebago Lake around 1968. 
My dad first bought two, 100’X 50’ lots and we started bringing our new tent trailer up there camping and spending most of the summers in Naples.  
The land’s location was atop a huge hill in the foothills of the White Mountains, which were some twenty miles away from New Hampshire. This development sold lots for camping use and we bought four more lots together now enabling us to put a septic tank in for a mobile home they eventually bought.  
I remember dad; with our help, cleared the land by making huge bonfires and burning the brush. The fire’s smoke that came from the burning pine branches brought the attention of fire marshals, tipped off by a fire spotter stationed all the way over in New Hampshire in the White Mountains. 
Dad loved his Naples getaway and he eventually bought 12 lots in total over a space of eight years. The three youngest kids in our family, Katie, Timmy, and I got the most out of our Maine campsite. 
Dad and I started bonding back in those days and I remember the time dad and I would take the Old Town canoe down at Muddy River and he’d take me fishing. 
This one day, we got up early and got in our canoe and we caught several large trout. Dad said he’d show me how to clean and cook the fish and we’d have them for breakfast. Yah, like fish and eggs for breakfast, cool!
One time this huge fish dad caught finally got in the boat and it was truly impressive! By now dad and I had caught three, and he was going to have a fish fry again. But all of a sudden, that big fish began to flip and flop, and jump and dad instinctively took off his moccasin and smacked this fish. Knocked it out cold! 
Well, we began heading to shore and the damn fish gave it one more herculean effort and flung itself right over the boat and swam away victoriously leaving us in its wake!
We were city kids at heart but would now morph more into half-country kids, half-city kids, with both influences changing our life perspectives. 
From the ages between eight and all the way up until I turned closer to eleven years old, we somewhat behaved ourselves with relatively no issues. 
As we got older however while this area eventually developed bringing more families where we eventually would make more friends, some of whom we would raise hell with way too often in the future. 
We met friends who were from Lewiston Maine called the Terrians. Bert and Ricky Terrian were wild Mainers who we got along with and hung out with for years.
I remember being with Ricky who thought it was a good idea to hotwire this rowboat and I had a canoe with an engine in it, not mine by the way, just borrowed kind of illegally you could say. 
He basically dared me to play chicken with him with it on Muddy River as nighttime closed in and we both throttled out machines full bore of course my canoe was up in the air because nobody was in the front of it, so it just overrode the other boat and they both just kind of turned in circles all hung up on themselves. 
This brings me to another time when Timmy’s friends, Jimmy Cameron and Mikey Burke came up to Maine. Some of Tim’s Boston buddies and we all got into our 18’ Old Town canoe, filled with four cases of beer and invited four girls to come hang out with us at Sandy Beach, about a mile or so paddle. 
As soon as we went through the bridge and came into big Sebago Lake the waves of the lake capsized the canoe. 
Do you think we immediately rescued the 2 girls who couldn’t swim? NO! Instead, we just began diving for the cases of beer and the poor girls were all hanging onto the half-sunken canoe for dear life! Not our proudest moment mind you!
By thirteen I was a weekend warrior, drinking beer, smoking pot, and sometimes both. On the weekends we came up from Boston and always ended up partying at different various places that we named Big Beach and Little Beach, nicknames everyone around our area called the two beaches off Muddy River which was Sebago Lake’s main tributary. 
We eventually made a secluded spot behind an old farm and named it Smokies Den. Campfires were always part of our experience and we were always careful not to light the woods on fire.   
On a hot summer day when I was around fifteen years old, I was hanging with Rusty Lashua, a childhood friend who had a camp at the end of our road. 
We climbed up in this 150-year-old tree which had a 6’ wide circumference on it, lit up a joint, and began smoking it. The year before we built a tire swing using a 3” thick rope and an old trailer tire which was really high up in the air.  
So, this one day as we were still up in the tree smoking this joint, Timmy approached us from our lot above. I put up one finger up to my mouth and whistled shhhh, which meant for Rusty to shut the fuck up!  
As Timmy approached us, I remember him humming something somewhat loudly. We did all we could do to keep from laughing aloud. 
Timmy got into the tire swing and started pushing off the old pine tree trunk. As he got up momentum, the humming continued to get louder as his speed and trajectory increased. 
I so happened to be carrying a jack-knife on me and I motioned to Rusty to again stop snickering.  
As Timmy swung freely back and forth, I was busy sawing the 3” thick rope. Almost as if Timmy were a cartoon figure humming and swinging like a madman, I managed to cut the final threads of the 3” rope just as Timmy reached the highest trajectory of his swing. 
It sounded rather like this, “Lalala, nanana, ladiladi-La Nanana, Ahhhhhh oh-Fuckkkkk!” as Timmy flew into the air for three seconds, landing with himself still inside the tire, now rolling down the steep hill and bouncing off the remains of this 200-year-old rock wall which eventually stopped him some 60’ away from where the tire swing used to hang.  
He got out of the tire dropping many f-bombs when he heard Rusty and I laughing hysterically in the tree above. As my father used to say, “The shit hit the fan!”  
Timmy got to his feet and began screaming he was going to fucking kill me! While initially hysterically laughing, I started climbing up the tree instinctually, not giving it much thought until a huge fist-sized rock bounced off the branch directly above me, hitting right above my head and ripping a huge chunk of bark off the tree.  
We began climbing as fast as we could, as the rocks he was throwing whizzed by us several times a second. He screamed, “You stupid mother fucker, I hurt my damn arm, I’m going to fucking kill you, you stupid fuckhead!” 
This tree was huge and the top of the tree must have been 250’ tall, once we both reached it, the White Mountains and Mount Washington were all in sight. We did reach the top very quickly, which was partly the reason I escaped being smacked by flying rocks. 
He continued screaming at me, promising my eventual ass-kicking would come very soon. When I saw my parents pulling into the driveway in their old Volvo station wagon, I knew I needed my dad to rescue me before crazy Timmy’s rocks found their target. 
I immediately began screaming to my dad, “Help, help, dad help, this crazy bastard is trying to kill us!” Dad came right down and came up to Timmy who was still hurling big stones at us. 
Dad grabbed Timmy and wrestled with him briefly and asked Timmy what was going on as he now very excitedly screamed to him what we did.  
Dad begged Tim to calm down, which he immediately did, once dad had a hold of him, preventing him from hurling any more rocks in my direction. 
Dad saved me again, a reoccurring theme he would later repeat many more times in my life. 
Another time after a night of partying at Big Beach, the bigger of the two beaches on Muddy River we hung out at, Jim O’Connor and I walked back up to the camp now a little buzzed from drinking beers. 
About Five minutes after we reached the upper lot at my parent’s place, Timmy arrived and began climbing the trail to the upper lot.  
The trail was over 200’ long and at the top, my father used some of the old 200-year-old rock walls which he rebuilt as a retention wall to keep the gravel he dumped to level the top of the lot and cover up the septic tank he had installed from eroding away, which also formed an area where we had a huge campfire sitting area at. 
Next to the wall were other random boulders lining a walkway, some too big to move, but others I thought quickly to myself might be able to be rolled! 
As Timmy approached the road below which led to the beginning of the trail, I saw a boulder that I thought I could roll. It was a massive boulder, probably weighing close to 400 pounds or more.  
Given the fact that it was fairly round, I therefore imagined I might be able to budge it from its resting place, and roll this beast down the hill at my unsuspecting brother. 
I told Jimmy my plan and he just laughed out loud at me shaking his head. As Tim started up the hill, I started heaving that heavy bitch out of its resting place and it shot out of my hands and began moving quickly down the hill, following that old indented trail. 
Timmy around this time was just starting his ascent up our back lot after I managed to set the boulder in motion. It quickly exploded into a full speedy roll gathering momentum every second it was rolling down the steep 40-degree decline toward Timmy. 
So, as I released the boulder the noise it made was masked by his own ascent over the downed branches from the windstorm we got the previous night and he didn’t hear or even notice the loud boulder barreling down the hill toward him while he was crunching on the branches. 
I heard for about six seconds sounds like this, “Crash, crash, crunch, crunch, crash, crash,” as the boulder followed the somewhat depressed pathway all the way down the hill!   
What it actually sounded like was, “Crash, crash, crunch, crunch, crash, crash, crash-ahhhhhhhhh, what the fuck!” As the boulder bowled Timmy down like a lone ten-pin hiding in the corner all by itself!
Funny as fuck we hooted loudly and rolled on the ground in a rip-roaring uncontrollable laugh which took nearly six seconds to recover from. I knew I had just about one minute to run away before Timmy caught up to me and knocked my teeth out. Damn I pranked my older brother good sometimes, didn’t I?
I snuck in later that night in the tent trailer where Timmy had already fallen asleep. The next day Timmy had somewhat calmed down and just looked at me in the morning and he called me a fucking moron!  
Even though we both fucked with each other and had many battles over the years, I loved Timmy very much and would have done anything for him. 
He toughened me up quite a bit over the years, battling with him as Irish brothers often did, but I do not ever regret those battles we had, because in the end, he is still my favorite brother!  
A great deal of crap happened during the earlier years, a lot of partying, fighting, and uncontrollable behavior that somehow became all too familiar with me. Funny, however, dad became much more stable and started being a good influence on me.  
However, my sister Katie, Timmy and I really put my parents through the wringer. 
The three of us often partied, smoking and drinking, while Timmy and I chose to scrape by life doing the bare minimum, which was a shame since Timmy and I were really smart but didn’t prepare ourselves for adulthood by studying and living up to our fullest potentials at all like my oldest brothers did.  
They still had more control over Katie though, forcing her to complete the four years of St. Clair’s Catholic High School and later Katie managed a BSN in Nursing at Northeastern University all still while partying. She completed school and passed her Nursing Boards on the first try. Smart!
The people she hung with were much like our friends as they partied hard and her best friend Patty ended up pregnant in a Catholic high school. 
They tried sending me to Catholic Memorial High School which I attended for 2.5 years but unlike Katie, I never graduated from CM. I had a much different path to follow! 
Another time when I was even younger when I was in the sixth grade, I remember we used to have rock fights. One night while we were having a rock fight I got hit in the eye with a rock and got hurt pretty bad!  
Unfortunately rushed to the wrong hospital, I went to the ER and sat there for four hours until my brother Michael came and told us to go downtown to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a hospital with a great reputation.  
Once I got to the Eye and Ear infirmary at Mass. General, they took 20 minutes to have scopes in my eyes and determined I had a semi-detached right Retina. That was the reason why earlier that day right after I got hit in the eye, I could only see a light blue haze through that eye.
I had to stay in the hospital for two months while my retina fused back into place. I remember my mom reading me Charlotte’s Web in its entirety while I was put on strict bed rest, drugged heavily so I would remain still. 
My right eye three weeks in still was not focusing too well at all and I continued laying there in my hospital bed, heavily sedated wondering if I would ever see through that eye again.  
Later the beginning of the fourth week on a hot June night, I decided to pull my right eye patch back and peek out of my bandages. When I did, I looked out a window that faced west down Storrow Drive and made out a structure in the distance that turned out to be in Kenmore Square.  
It was the Citco sign out over left field bleachers at our famous beloved Fenway Park. I immediately called the nurse through my intercom and she appeared seconds later. I was so happy; I remember my brain was bursting to tell her the good news that I could now finally see.  
She pulled the patch completely off now, with the room lights still dimmed, and then at that moment I was fully able to clearly see that iconic symbol of the Boston Red Sox baseball team’s unofficial logo, the Citco sign, lighting up in the distance with those iridescent lights that shown so colorfully and brightly all over our great city.  
What was somewhat coincidental was just that the next year the Massachusetts Historic Society decided to make the Citco sign a permanent city landmark, a landmark with great personal significance to me! 
When I got out and came home one sunny spring afternoon, I was supposed to remain stationary at home with limited movement for at least another couple of months and slowly could start getting back into a routine. 
In the meantime, David O’Brien came in and started chatting with me. He first apologized for hitting me with the rock but further went on to say, “I got punished for hitting you in the eye and had to miss a school dance that weekend because of you.”  
Well, the nerve of this asshole! I ended up in the hospital for almost two months because of him. I flipped out and began punching him as many times as I could before my dad ran downstairs to break it up. 
I did this without thinking about any possible bad consequences that may happen considering it was right after I left the hospital. It wasn’t very smart!
Age 13 began for me by drinking on the weekends with friends. Marijuana also became somewhat of a habit as well, as I began smoking weed with my brother down the arboretum.  
As we smoked a couple of joints my first time, I remember feeling very euphoric and had a sense of overwhelming excitement as I sat there stoned. This began a love affair I had for weed that lasted 10 years.
One night my brother and I along with six friends decided to break into my neighbor’s house across the street, the Dragonette’s. They lived on the arboretum side of the street, so breaking in would not be very visible to our other neighbors.  
We climbed to the second-floor window by climbing up a trellis, which Mr. Dragonette used to grow his own grapes to produce some of his crappy homemade wine. 
When we first got into the house, we started to look downstairs to see if Mr. Dragonette had any wine fermenting. We actually found some but thought after tasting it we may be better off getting to his kitchen liquor cabinet to steal his hard liquor.  
Just as Timmy and I opened up the liquor cabinet door, we actually heard our mother scream “Chrissy, Timmy time for dinner.” 
We stopped in our tracks, looked at each other and Timmy barked orders to the crew to steal some booze and hide it up the arbs for the next night, a Friday night in early July.  
The next day Timmy and I met with our neighbors up the arbs and we all went up to Motley Hill and walked down the hill where pancake rock stood. We climbed up the pancake and went to the other side where Weld Street divided the 1st and 2nd arbs.  
Now stoked to see that they stole like seven bottles of booze we all sat there opening various bottles and began pounding straight alcohol. 
I began drinking straight gin almost vomiting a few times at its disgusting taste but drank the good part of a pint by myself and quickly went into a blackout.  
We made it to my street and we sat on the Fraine’s wall when all of a sudden, I did not feel too well. It was probably a good thing that I did begin to puke as I had drunk enough to probably kill myself.
Mrs. Abisso who watched me vomiting uncontrollably did escort me from the Fraine’s wall and knocked on our door and my dad answered. 
They brought me into the kitchen and I threw up into a bucket provided to me by my very unhappy father, which dad immediately knew I was drunk off my ass. 
I was still sick and throwing up as he began grilling me over and over about how I got the alcohol. He kept at it until I just broke. I thought if I just told him he would stop his interrogation and let me go to bed.  
I spilled the beans and I mean on everyone. His response was strange as he went across the street and got Mrs. Dragonette and brought her to our kitchen, where I sat there still throwing up into that bucket.  
She looked at me as my dad told her what we did, still scolding me. She, however, interceded and came over and rubbed my head and said, “Poor, poor boy, he has suffered enough, don’t punish him anymore, he learned his lesson.” 
I remember at that point my dad pulled out his checkbook and wrote a check to cover the damages and the cost of the booze we stole as he profusely apologized for our crappy behavior.
Well, Timmy got his ass kicked while I sat there still puking. Everyone, like six more dudes all, got into trouble because dad went to everyone’s house and told the other offender’s parents of our crime. 

Normally I would never have ratted, never! However, I was so fucking sick, I just had to end dad’s incessant cross-examination and the only way to make it stop was admitting to everything. Boy was Timmy pissed!


Chapter 2: Our Experimentation Days
 
We started experimenting with minor drugs around 14 years old, like hits of THC, mescaline, windowpane (LSD) and other mind-altering drugs that would occupy us 6-10 hours on any given day, usually on a Saturday. Mostly we just smoked pot though! 	
Coincidentally this is when I started hearing voices that I now suspect were symptoms of early onset schizophrenia which I honestly think I began drugging myself on purpose to kill the voices or dull their strength, but to only in fact strengthen their frequency and intensity!
Many times, I recollect I had noticeable auditory hallucinations where I could read peoples thoughts almost like an insanely accurate intuition of what they were thinking and often was proven right by my accuracy of me being able to predict what was said or done next! 
Even today I believe I am telepathic which means according to Webster Dictionary is supposedly capable of transmitting thoughts to other people and them to me and I take it a bit further and think I have a keen sense to read peoples thoughts. 
One of my first LSD trips was with Jimmy and Ogg up the arbs. We were tripping balls on LSD and Jimmy on top of Motley Hill (called Peters or Bussey’s Hill by today’s yuppies) decided to blow his nose and throw his snotty napkin on the ground.  
Damn if that did not get my goat! Since I was tripping so hard, I took it upon myself to lecture Jimmy for what must have been 15 minutes of deep amounts of self-righteous indignation on how he could possibly litter the Arnold Arboretum, a tree museum full of historic relevance that featured Revolutionary War gravesites behind our house in the arbs. 
Jimmy for the whole 15 minutes just stood there staring back at me taking in everything I was articulating tripping balls and finally looked me right in the eyes and said, “For fuck sakes, what are you fucking Euell Gibbons or something, shut the fuck up!” 
God that is all Ogg needed to hear, he laughed and laughed repeating the now new nickname Jimmy inadvertently gave me, “Euell Gibbons!” 
So henceforth, I was now going to be known by many as Euell, but only a few were allowed to call me it! Some guys who heard the nickname tried calling this to me but I thought it was disrespectful since we had no real history together and I would threaten them to never say it again. Although Jimmy was the originator of my name, Ogg was responsible for making it stick. 
Ogg argues today that he was the one who came up with the name, but seeing it was 45 years ago, I don’t think he remembers it that clearly! 
Ogg was given his name as a kid by his street hockey team players because they said he looked like a cave man. They gave him his name “Ogg” which drove him to come up with everybody’s own unique nickname he cleverly came up with usually while we were baked. 
I guess I named Jimmy O’Connor “Chink Eyes,” because Jimmy’s eyes when stoned looked slanted like a Clinamen’s. But for the most part, Ogg invented the majority of nick-names we were all familiar with. 
John O’Hearn got the nickname “Dah” because while up the arboretum on pancake rock, smoking a ton of weed, Ogg and I looked at John being goofy as usual and we both decided to simultaneously push him down this huge cliff nicknamed “Pancake Rock!”  
John being very athletic actually was able to keep his balance and run down this wicked steep decline turning around toward the bottom to scream, “Ahh you fuckers, I made it!”  
Still moving quite fast he ran through a 6” deep muddy puddle where he got his white converse sneakers covered in thick black mud and seconds later completely slipped getting covered in mud. Ogg and I laughed so hard and then Ogg yelled out “Duh, Duh, you’re fucking Duh!” This stuck forever too!
Christy O’Hearn got his nickname from Ogg as well. Ogg gave him the name “Crusty” unceremoniously one day when we were all gathered up in Chrissy’s attic getting high and Ogg looked down at Chrissy, who was just wearing his white BVD’s and started laughing aloud and then blurted out, “Look his fucking underwear is crusty WTF, “Crusty!” 
This became Chrissy’s nickname but because he was still quite a scary dude no one except the guys in that room were ever able to call him this.  
Tom Greely an older friend of ours would get weed from Crusty, John’s brother and then often drove us around getting us all high with it. He came by our neighborhood to hang out with us often and knew Jimmy Creaser very well too.  
We nicknamed Tom “Ganges Greely” for smoking Ganges weed out of a German Meerschaum pipe during a Black Sabbath concert. He made the mistake of passing his pipe down the row to a few chicks we did not even know and somewhere along the line someone pocketed his beautiful Meerschaum pipe.  
Then there was Billy J and Chris J. They were big tough Lebanese brothers who were older and we hung with them mainly to get high and supply them from weed from John’s brother.
This one day, Billy and I went for a drive in his Fiat down the J-Way and out of the blue, a huge Cadillac almost ran us off the road. 
If you knew Billy like I knew him, that wasn’t going to fly. Jamming to Pink Floyd Money, and smoking a J, Billy races up to him and doing about 100 mph, cuts him off and whips around him with that J hanging out of his mouth. 
I was so scared watching those massive Oak trees whipping by that I just sat back and thought wtf! He then took out a rubber mallet from under his seat, leaned out the car and whaled it on this guy’s hood of his car and proceeded to drive around him never stopping, as the driver in this huge Cadillac was in total shock as Billy J blew right by him doing 120 mph!
Knowing The Jamaica Way was rated one of the deadliest roads in America, I had visions of a fatal accident that never happened! Billy was talented and very crazy!!!
Ogg virtually nicknamed everyone he knew giving a new name to many as a way to deflect from his own nickname of Ogg. Everybody called him Ogg, even my mother who he in return was nicknamed Attila by Ogg. I imagine it bothered him to some degree, but he was cool about it! 
At about the same period of time, I loved skiing in New Hampshire with Michael my oldest brother. Most of the time I went skiing with Michael and kids he was in charge of from the YES program. Hanging with Mike usually meant that I would be sober and not smoking weed! 
This would change as one time, I brought John O’Hearn with me. As we rose up the mountain on the ski lift it began snowing hard. John lit a joint and we began smoking it. Since we were heading to the top of the mountain, we passed the first ski ramp, but we were not getting off there, we were heading to the top.  
My damn poles at that moment however had slid down as we came upon the ramp since by now, I was getting too stoned, breaking both poles instantly leaving two little stubs. John laughed hysterically as we continued climbing in the ski-lift up the mountain still snowing, still smoking that joint.  
John then said, “Hey Yule we should race to the bottom, I bet I can kick your ass!” Because I was stoned and embarrassed for breaking my poles my giant ego said, “Sure let’s do it!”  
We got off the lift and I started skiing down the hill with John in the lead. I decided then that I wasn’t going to lose to him, fuck him, he just laughed at me, so I just crouched down and skied straight down the mountain like some possessed fucking Olympic downhill skier without any slalom action to slow me down!  
I found myself skiing very fast hitting patches of ice which quickened my decent. Like a drunken amateur I quickly passed John taking the lead with my little stubby poles, hearing him laugh even louder at that point. I must have been going 65 mph when I shot over a steep ridge, only to land below, on this poor 70-year-old unsuspecting woman, wiping her out instantly!  
I managed however to avoid a direct head on collision, avoiding her a split second before impact, but enough to almost give her a fucking heart attack. I wiped both of us out and went into a head over heels roll down the icy slope. John victoriously passed me by almost a minute later laughing his ass off still!  
John and I always had been very competitive whether it was playing football, billiards, ping-pong, street hockey, skiing or anything that would incite rivalry. 
John and Ogg often would both fuck with me up until I started getting really pissed. At that point both of them having a somewhat healthy fear of me often would back off, but not until they embarrassed me deeply!
Ogg denies this totally, but I still think they thought I was still pretty nuts so the ribbing I took never got too bad. 
Another time hanging with Ricky and Bert Terrian, we decided to go to Malden and have a sleep over at Donna Spinelli’s house. 
Donna and Diane were Italian girls we hung out with who also had a place in Maine but were from Malden, Ma. and we got invited for a sleep over down in Massachusetts. So, Tim and I met Bert and Ricky, two guys from Lewiston Maine who also partied at Naples with us.
As we got there, as their mom welcomed us in and told us she’d have dinner ready for us like around 5:30 or so! 
We accepted of course trying to be polite and we got downstairs and Bert somehow snuck in like 3 cases of beer. 
That’s not all! He talked all of us guys into dropping acid and reluctantly we all did so, forgetting the fact that in two hours from that time, Mrs. Spinelli was going to have dinner ready for us all to eat.
If you know anything about LSD, you’d know you just about start peaking about two hours from taking the LSD and at that moment, Donna’s mom called downstairs and said “you guys come upstairs right now, dinners ready!”
OMG what a scene! I call it hotdog mountain! There must have been like 30 red hotdogs stacked up like a fucking pyramid and since we were all tripping balls, no one could eat anything! 
I felt horrified! Here is this poor woman going out of her way and we all just sat there just giggling at hotdog mountain! 
Feeling feelings intensely since I was now tripping my ass off, I grabbed a hotdog and put some mustard and relish on it. Not the least bit hungry mind you! And I put it in my mouth! 
Crunch, crunch, crunch I chewed this red piece of meat, but it wouldn’t go down my throat! It was basically fucking just stuck there and I was in trouble! My eyes began watering and I was chocking, then I grabbed some damn lemonade that she made and washed it down, thank God. But I wasn’t going to try another friggin bite!  
Bert, Timmy, Ricky and the other Ricky were all laughing their nuts off at me and Mrs. Spinelli asked us “what’s wrong.” 
Donna knew immediately we were all on something and said, don’t worry mom they’ll eat it later and she went off into the other room perplexed as we ran downstairs like freaking idiots that we all were! 
OMG I’m so sorry Mrs. Spinelli! Thanks for the food! Sorry we couldn’t eat your hotdog mountain! We were all too fucked up! At least I tried!
Catholic Memorial days were fun. My best friend Jim O’Connor who at first lived on my street, eventually moved to Cape Cod in Hyannis before my near second grade nervous breakdown happened and eventually moved back to the next town over when I graduated from junior high. 
We rekindled our friendship and often hung out on weekends and on some school days. Of course it meant drinking and by this time we started smoking marijuana. Weed was a drug we all fell in love with that changed our personalities quite a bit. 
This changed me for sure from a casual weekend warrior to an almost every day partier that smoked daily, which eventually led to experimentation with other street drugs.  
Jim and I started hanging out with Ogg and John and sometimes with John’s older brother. The four of us, John, Ogg, Jimmy and I became a close interwoven pack of friends who became inseparable during these early days. 
Timmy split his time hanging out with us and his new gang of friends who drank heavy as Timmy preferred doing, they nicknamed themselves “The Dirtbags.”  
They were also into mischief as we were, constantly getting into fights with others they crossed. All of them took on the character names of the Star Trek enterprise crew, where Timmy became “Bones.” Everyone called Timmy bones, maybe except for me because he was just Timmy to me. 
Timmy one night up in the Arbs confronted the Torgersen’s for breaking bottles. He yelled at the two x-marines explaining that this was all of our homes and that they should stop it.  
They told him to fuck off and continued smashing bottles as Timmy screamed, “You mother fuckers stop breaking the damn bottles,” which prompted them to jump Timmy breaking a rib and chipping one of his teeth. I know damn well if I were there that night the shit would not have gone down like that. 
First of all, they definitely wouldn’t have jumped Timmy as I would have taken on one of the much older brothers and Timmy would have fought the other. I regret that I was not there that night to fight those jerks as I am sure things would have turned out much different than it did.  
John’s oldest brother was a war hero who served in the 101st Airborne Ranger division and fought in Vietnam during the Tet offensive. He received three purple hearts and a Silver Star for combat operations in Vietnam.  
This dude was very crazy and it was cool to hang out with him sometimes because he always had great smoke. When he told some of his Nam stories to us, it made me want to emulate him and be just like him, a guy with a tough reputation and a someone everyone knew had balls.   
Everybody who knew him, knew he was a badass. Right off the bat I wanted to be just like him, having that character that would never take shit from anybody, to have that street cred. 
His stories filled me up with much bravado and would influence how I carried myself and act just a little bit crazier, making guys scared to fuck with me.  
Thinking back, I think my dad gave me quite a bit of this too as well, dad always demanded respect from others and if he perceived he didn’t receive it, he would go bonkers, hence the ass kicking he gave to the Archbishop Humberto Sousa Medeiros years earlier. 
Catholic Memorial was good for me to some degree. I actually received quite a good education while I was there, all while still pulling crap like lighting up joints in the back of typing and geometry classes. One day in geometry class sitting next to my JV quarterback Wally McDonough, I decided to pull out a roach of Columbian gold and light it up.  
I asked Wally if he wanted a hit but he laughed and refused. So, sitting in my desk those single unit desks with the desktop and chair attached together, I leaned up against the wall where I decided to light up the roach and smoke it while the Catholic Brother was at the chock board explaining some Geometric equations to us.  
The Brother who had just turned around decided to yell, “By God Cronin, if you don’t sit down in that dam chair and get off that wall, you are going to fall on your goddamn head!” 
Just as the smoke reached the front of the room my chair did slip and I did hit my head on the wall as he predicted God would do to me. At that exact same moment he screamed, “Who the hell is smoking that crap in here?” Nobody ratted me out, they didn’t dare!  
Jimmy O’Connor and I hung out quite a bit in our teens. I often brought him up to Maine with me. One time with Jimmy and Timmy, we went up with my dad in the winter to shovel the roof off at our summertime mobile home. 
Tim brought some LSD and a few hits of double barrel THC up with him. Jim and I took the THC and Timmy actually dropped both a hit of THC and a hit of LSD.  
All wasted for most of that day I remember exploring the frozen Muddy River, eventually ending up back up at camp where we decided to grab our toboggan and go behind the Sweetland’s cabin to coast down their back road which was a long and very steep icy mountain hill road.  
Our first few runs were amazing as we must have gotten our speeds up to 60 MPH. About our third run with Timmy in front as usual, we started down the steep icy hill road. 
As we flew down the steep grade again, Timmy with his legs crossed which meant his knees were hanging over the toboggan, hit a piece of frozen firewood that had iced itself to the surface of the steep decline. He hit it with such force; it drove Timmy right off the toboggan wiping all of us out.  
As Jim and I recovered from our wipeout we saw Timmy who was now limping around screaming holding his right knee in excruciating pain. Now very baked we approached Timmy somewhat cautiously after following a blood trail that led us still following him toward our camp. 
When we caught up to him, I saw his right pants torn at the knee and further looked at his wound and saw a huge chunk of meat hanging off it.  His kneecap was basically hanging off!
Oh god it was so fucking gross especially on THC! It grossed me out so bad and because I was so high, it made me puke. We made it back to camp and my dad wrapped Timmy’s knee so the blood would not get all over the car as we all drove with him to the Bridgton Hospital.  
Tim saw the doctor immediately and the doctor shot Timmy’s leg up with Novocain as he attempted to sew it back up. Tim was already tripping plus on THC and had said he felt the weirdest sensation from the mixture of drugs as the Novocain surged throughout his leg and he said he felt it going up his leg into his brain. 
Timmy blurted out “Wow” immediately following the shot. I think he got something like 15 stitches on his knee, which grounded us in the trailer the remainder of the night, with dad convinced we were all on drugs. But still played cards with us most of the night. 
Motley Hill was another place where we would toboggan. This hill went from a fairly steep decline to a very steep decline a quarter mile down it. It was lined with Japanese Cherry trees at the bottom of the hill. 
One winter night under a full moon we began the night chugging Southern Comfort and howling at the full moon in preparation for our kamikaze suicide mission.  
We started down the icy Arboretum hill where Timmy rather reminded me of a Japanese Bonsai Suicide Pilot as he once again took the drivers position heading down what we referred to as our suicide mission.  
We flew down the hill toward the bottom as Timmy screamed lean left, lean left! We all leaned left, but to no avail as the bottom of the hill was 3” of thick ice. Timmy hit a four-inch branch from the Japanese Cherry Tree and was immediately knocked out.  
I forget who was with me that night other than Timmy, but I remember loading him back up onto the toboggan and pulling him all the way home back home. 
Still being very inebriated from the Southern Comfort we drank, we decided to leave Tim on the toboggan and knocked on my front door running away before someone in my house answered. 
Feeling sorry to have thrown Timmy under the bus like that, I realized I had no choice unless I was going to confront my dad and get caught drinking again.  
My cellar at home was furnished with a pool table and it doubled as a ping pong table. I learned how to play pool on it as a kid and got really good my whole life! 
One time however, Tim and I had 3 other guys with us in the cellar and we decided to get stoned in the bathroom. We smoked some hash and as we were almost finished, we heard a knock on the door and Timmy in a high-pitched squeal said, “who is it?”
It was dad and he said in a pissed off voice, “who the hell is in there?” We said in unison, “oh shit” and we opened the door and Tim pushed out our three friends first and Tim and I last. But as we walked by Freddy (Dad) he slammed our heads together and we stammered out of the basement running for our lives. Sorry Dad!
So, one time Dad took Tim and I to church and sat between us to keep us 2 idiots from causing trouble. 
If it wasn’t for Timmy wearing that stupid fur collared hat on, I’ have been just fine! 
So, Timmy sat there looking all sorts of stupid with his stupid furry hat on and it was kind of pissing me off!
I decided to reach behind my father and push Tim’s hat down over his eyes. By the third time doing this, he reached around my father and cracked me in the mouth!
Fuck, Dad had had it! He grabbed us both up by the collar’s and yanked us out of our seats into the isle, screaming, I’m going to fucking kill you two! This was proceeded to him slamming our heads together!  Slam, that fucking hurt!
Our friends’ older brothers were big-time dealers mainly of marijuana, but occasionally they had other drugs too! One summer we had opium and got high daily on it up the arbs! It was a fun high, and made everything really funny and mellow. 
We got high almost one whole summer with it but all of a sudden, our supply was gone! Withdrawals out the ying-yang and they were not too fun either. We got over this by smoking weed daily and drinking for me on the weekends. We were freakin party animals back then!                        

                       Goonoo Bruno
Michael Bruno was an older guy with a car that we used for rides often, but primarily we let him hang out with us because he would buy weed from John and he would smoke it all with us after. We smoked a ton of Bruno’s weed with him, and it was always very good strong pot too.
Mike was basically a pussy. Everyone took advantage of him which sometimes resulted in guys beating him up and bullying him. I took it upon myself to defend him sometimes, even though I messed with him the most in our group. 
Michael appreciated the fact that nobody would mess with him when he was with us. One day we were out of weed and we conned Michael into going inside his house to get some cash. It was a raw foggy afternoon as we sat on the corner convincing him to get money.  
His neighbors just pulled into their driveway and began unloading their groceries to their home. A box had fallen onto the ground, so I curiously went over to see what it was. It turned out to be a new box of Kotex pads. Being a punk, I thought it would be funny to pull a prank on Mike.  
Mike was such a goon! We called him Goono Bruno for a reason and kept everyone else from fucking with him. Well unbeknownst to Ogg and John, I ripped the box open and grabbed a pad, taking the glue strip protective paper off it. Mike by then was wearing down from our continued demands to get cash for us to buy weed again.  
I came up to him and said, “Go in the damn house and get us cash please!” Well at that point, he finally agreed and started for his front door. I put my arm around him, patted his back saying, “you’re a good dude Mike.” As I patted his back, I attached the pad as he walked into his house now wearing the Kotex rag on his back.  
John and Ogg started laughing so hard! John said, “Yule you’re so fucking mean, you’re a dick!” Michael must have been in for about five minutes when he came out of his front door with his dad grabbing and pulling him toward us by his ear, now screaming at all of us.  
His father spun him Mike around with him still wearing the rag on his back, as all three of us were on the ground laughing hysterically. His dad began screaming, “You guys are gonna get it! My other son is a black belt and he’s going to kick all your asses!”  
We were all in a full-blown hysterics laughing fit. His father who continued to yell at us, sounded like he was screaming foof, foof, foof.  
OMG if I wasn’t going to hell for this, I don’t know what it would take to get me sentenced there. Ogg of course later named Bruno’s father foof-foof as we retold our story many times to others. 
On another Bruno adventure, we bribed Mike by giving him some weed and hired him as our driver for the day. He happily agreed to it, even though we told him the four of us were dropping some acid. John’s bright idea was for us to drive downtown to the Science Museum.  
As we arrived and being the fourth guy inline as we approached the science museum ticket counter line, I noticed at that moment, that I was beginning to trip. 
John and Ogg suddenly leapt over the turnstile leaving a scared and confused Bruno in front of me. I screamed at him to move his ass and we both jumped the turnstile too.  
We all ran into the museum with a security guard in hot pursuit of us. Since we all ran in different directions, I decided to hide in this huge 15’ tractor tire exhibit and climbed inside the tire where I hid for about five minutes. 
I heard a guard talk on the walkie-talkie and said he was continuing his search further down the south-east corridor of the museum.  
A minute later I climbed out of the tire and went into another section looking for my friends. I searched for them and I thought I heard the security guard coming again, so I ran off and went into another exhibit room down this corridor in the museum. 
As I leaned on the wall, I started or so I thought I started having auditory hallucinations. I could actually hear my heart beating as I leaned against this one wall. 
I thought I was having an out-of-body tripping experience when Ogg came from around the corner and looked at me, as I was frozen against the wall pale faced, now tripping balls.  
He laughed and asked me what was wrong with me since I looked so scared and I told him, “God I’m so fucked up, I can hear my own heartbeat.” He looked at me and how serious I was and started laughing at me again hysterically.  
We then followed a winding tunnel around a turn where there were exhibits on the wall of different types of drugs behind a Plexiglas protective wall. As I pushed a button on the drug exhibit, a heartbeat would begin beating louder and louder to imitate what a heart would sound like on that particular drug.  
All of us got a laugh at the idea that I thought I was hearing my own heartbeat. I was relieved to realize it wasn’t me and I laughed along too.  
One Friday night I was hanging down the square away from my friends when I saw Michael across the street. I approached him and noticed someone had given him a black eye. 
Without any hesitation I asked him who did it. He told me someone he knew stole his weed from him and he tried getting it back but the dude smacked him. I told Mike we would get his weed back and asked him where this guy was.  
At first, he said for me not to bother, but I insisted and convinced him this dude had to pay. I knew if I did not stop it now, it would just escalate and become a reoccurring scene Mike would face and although we fucked with him a lot, I still liked Mike enough to stop anyone else from messing with him. 
We walked back up to the arbs where we saw this kid with his friends and I noticed there were five of them getting high with Mike’s weed.  
I walked up to the kid who punched Mike and I asked him if he thought he was tough. He said in a not so certain tone of voice that he thought he was. I gave him one chance by asking him nicely if he’d give Mike back his weed, but he replied no fucking way. 
So, I just punched him really hard in the stomach and watched him fall to his knees completely out of breath gasping for air.  
He began squealing at me that he was sorry, so I just said, “Tell Mike you’re sorry and give him back his fucking weed.” He apologized to Mike, then after he got to his feet, he handed him back his pot.  
The five of them had heard I was pretty nuts with a crazy reputation and decided they would not even try messing with me. 
They had heard of me and knew who my friends were and none of them tried jumping me because they knew my friends and I would beat their asses. I told all five of them that if any one of them screwed with Mike again, they would have to deal with me.  
Nobody there that day ever messed with Mike again. I myself was pretty mean to him though, but I kept everyone else from screwing with him from then on. Although I was probably Mike’s biggest nemesis, he was somewhat thankful that I kept everyone else from messing with him.  
Another time with Ogg and Bruno we decided to go cruising smoking some pot. Mike was driving and he started giving me some shit trying to act tough in front of Ogg for whatever reason. I was sitting behind him, so I wanted to bust his balls and see if I could get him to drive with me covering his eyes as I barked out directions, such as steer right or steer left.  
According to Ogg however, that night also involved us getting John who was bringing 2 ounces of pharmaceutical coke over to Patrick’s. Either I was too stoned from smoking or I just didn’t care, I decided to fuck with Bruno since he started kind of zooing on me along with John and Ogg.  
Ogg was sitting in the front seat as Bruno drove and I guess John was sitting next to me and I leapt onto the back of the front seat, holding Bruno’s eyes shut, barking out orders for Mike to steer left or right. 
Ogg screamed fucking Yule as he pushed me off him, yelling at me to stop. I jumped almost into the front seat, as Ogg and I began kind of fighting, while Bruno started fucking whining like a little bitch.   
I was very baked and didn’t realize we had coke on us. I don’t remember John, but maybe we just dropped him off downtown at Patrick’s condo. In any case Ogg was very pissed at me that night. 
Getting back to Rossie, Ogg had enough, so we dropped him off at home and Bruno and I drove off into the night. We headed up toward White Stadium. 
I took over the driving at that point, even though I did not have a license. We drove behind White Stadium and went down this tarred path where we came upon about ten black dudes partying around a campfire. 
We were too deep down the narrow path in the woods and had no way of turning around. So, I decided to just punch it and drove Mike’s car right over and through the camp fire as those black guys all jumped into the bushes to save their own lives. 
Michael screamed, “Yule, you crazy fuck” and we drove right over the four-foot flame not hesitating for one second. We hit something and blew out a tire, but there was no way I was going to stop, so I just kept driving until we got about a half a mile away in relative safety.  
So, as I mentioned before, Mike from time to time would try to look tough in front of John and Ogg and he tried giving me shit. Well, I decided to use Mike as a tackling dummy one night, as I made Mike stand there and I would just tackle the shit out of him. I asked him if he still thought he was tough, and he definitely said yes.  
Huh, damn boy did have balls. I even grabbed him by the ankles and dragged him through a pile of dog shit on the church lawn where we were one night. 
He screamed at me to stop, which I did and he never tried to zoo on me ever again. Messing with Mike probably gave me bad future karma, which I paid for in spades later in life!  
CM was fun; I now wish I had pushed myself to study harder when I was there, but I was really just a fuck-up back then. 
Michael my oldest brother elected to take the task of occasionally watching me after school when I was a sophomore and I would commute to the Murphy School in Dorchester to hang out, working out lifting weights in their gym. Dan Burke also had a side gig over at the Murphy school, but was primarily the JV football coach at CM. 
My brother also ran the YES program in Boston and took inner city youths up-country to snow-ski or kayak in the summer. Mike was a great influence in my life, which gave me a much-needed break from hanging out with my Rossie buds at home.  
Once I overheard this kid call Michael a fag, and yes Michael was gay, but no one was going to fuck with my oldest brother at all, especially in front of me. 
So, I grabbed this punk and whipped him into a glass door, pushing him through the now closed door, throwing him on the ground. He never opened his mouth ever again, as he became pretty petrified of me. 
One day after CM JV football practice, I decided to play a pick-up game of football behind an eight-foot fenced in beautiful elite rich private school field at Roxbury Latin over in West Roxbury, but that day I unfortunately tore every ligament in my right ankle.  
It was so bad, my ankle swelled up and I had to loosen up my sneaker laces because of the intense pain. When I did, the swelling exploded into an ugly swollen pumpkin. I remember limping to where this eight-foot fence was and tried to climb over it with my messed-up ankle.  
Climbing up was not so bad but landing on the ground partially on that ankle killed. Dr. McDonough our family physician diagnosed my ankle saying I tore all my ligaments and tendons completely.  
Back then orthopedic surgery was in its infancy, so no surgery was recommended. This would mean the end of CM football days.  
Tommy Heinson, the famous Celtic player and Celtic Head coach had his son on our team. When this 6’-7” kid saw me the next morning in class on crutches, he started immediately zooing on me, calling me a pussy.  
Fuck him I thought, so I dropped my crutches and leapt at him trying to punch him but everyone there interceded by breaking it up, probably saved me from getting my ass kicked, but at least I showed him I wasn’t a pussy!  
The next day now on Percocet with my ankle wrapped up, crutches by my side and in my living room, blasting “Machine Gun,” a great hardcore Hendrix song, Ogg began strumming the strings of our Baby Grand Piano with a joint hanging out of his mouth as my mother walked into the living room and she shrieked, “Turn off that fucking shit now!”  
Then she focused on Ogg, who was still strumming the damn piano and screamed, “Ogg get the fuck out of here now!” He cuffed his joint and squeezed by my mother cautiously, kind of laughing, while she stood there herself kind of in shock ready to smack him. 
 The next day when Ogg and John called me at my house, Ogg came up with a nickname for my mother. It was “Attila.” They got a huge laugh out of it and teased me relentlessly which was always at my expense. 
Well as it happened later that same year, Brother Donohue, a new younger brother decided to smack me in the mouth for talking during of all things, CCD class. 
He threw me out in the hall and I stood there for a second, now fuming. I then remember looking back in class, as Wally McDonough was gesturing behind Donohue’s back for me to hit him back.  
I tried to get a shot in but he blocked it as my x-football coach Dan Burke came out in the hallway behind me to aid brother Donahue, who then preceded to throw me up against the lockers.   
Well, soon thereafter they called my dad of course and he decided to offer me an out. He asked me if I wanted to change schools and go to a Boston Public School called Another Course to College.
This school took kids from all over the city which was located near the Boston Commons, a school that affiliated itself with the U-Mass Boston campus and taught college level courses.  
He sold me on the idea, telling me there were also girls at this school too. The thought of that whole scenario brought about a huge smile to my face. Also, another thought raced into my head all of a sudden.  
I always wanted to play football at White Stadium, the biggest high school football stadium in the country which my father ran. 
He actually grew the grass there that year in which I eventually played on. His job was the Assistant Athletic Director for the Boston School Committee and I wanted so bad to be his only son to play ball there.  
A lifelong dream was now going to be a reality. I wanted so bad to make my father proud and deep down inside I knew I eventually would! 
Leaving CM behind for me was somewhat sad. I also felt kind of like a looser, that I could not hack the discipline needed to handle the Catholic Brothers. I also had a ton of friends that I spent 2.5 years with there.  
While there, I was hanging with both jocks and veges, (guys who were potheads and partiers). I played football for CM, regarded as one of the best teams in the hardest division in our state.  
When I went out for the team, I was 16 years old, 155 lbs. soaking wet guy, but was quick and had good hands as a receiver. Our school went through a two-week football camp where we did two a day workouts the entire time. 
We ate great food at camp too and I remember having a good time there. That year the Varsity won state and hoisted yet another trophy to be put in the over flowing trophy case.  
I had practiced hard and worked myself into great shape while I was there. I began lifting weights and running during these first days of school sports at CM and it began to show dividends. 
I also started to gain a reputation as a tough kid back home in Roslindale. I was especially hungry to be a good football player since my dad ran the athletic department for all of Boston Public Schools. In the back of my mind, I knew I wanted to play there, being the only kid in our family to play in front of him.  
So, going to my new school meant for me, to be riding the Orange line downtown, passing some of the most economically distressed areas of the inner city. 
We passed Green Street and Eggleston stations where White Stadium was located way up on the hill by Franklin Park Zoo. Next stop on this route was Dudley, the stop where Madison Park High School was located.  
Dudley was my assigned area school because of bussing, if I decided to play high school sports; I had to play here near the projects with the majority of kids who were black city youths, which eventually became my teammates in track and football.  
Going to ACC, (Another Course to College) meant that I would be commuting downtown right at the Boston Commons, up on Beacon Hill, less than a mile from the gold domed Massachusetts Capital building. 
I would join a select crop of kids from different parts of the city, including Southie, Eastie, West Roxbury, the North End, Roslindale, Dorchester, Hyde Park and Jamaica Plane and Roxbury. 
We had a college curriculum meant to prepare us for college after we were to graduate from ACC. Affiliated with UMass Boston, we had to commute to U-Mass Boston Campus in the afternoon and take college math and English courses to prepare us for college. 
This school granted us a level of freedom I soon took advantage of, enabling us to leave campus whenever we pleased and I abused the privilege immediately by smoking pot too. 
First off, there were now girls in my school, a setting that I had not been in since being in junior high back in Roslindale. 
I awkwardly communicated with these girls because I was shy, not use to being with them and occasionally high on pot. Although I found it difficult; however, I still really wanted to fit in and have a cute girlfriend.  
Thinking back to this time I felt such a strange sense of depression, which I could not understand. Partially it was because I had terrible social skills, a horrible self-esteem and I think what a huge factor was also, was I turned 17 years old the prior summer and I began feeling the beginnings of what I later had been diagnosed with of having, schizoaffective disorder.  
So, looking back now, I can definitely see the correlation to me doing drugs and drinking and performing a sort of self-medication, to counteract the sensations of having a schizoaffective disorder, which dominated my life back then! 
I could hear voices as some kind of auditory hallucinations which clearly were the start of having a telepathic ability mixed in with paranoid ideations that confused me to the core. No wonder I used drugs and alcohol to escape reality!
I could not figure out why I openly looked so depressed as well! Kids would often ask me why I looked so down, and I couldn’t think of a good response. 
I for no reason, felt like an outcast. To me I thought everyone knew there was something wrong with me!   
I concocted what I thought was a reasonable excuse as to why I seemed so sad and that was a cover story I had made up that my oldest brother had died in Vietnam. 
I made the mistake of telling someone this justification of my depressed state of mind but did not realize it would take on a life of its own.  
I thought in my weird state of mind, kids would accept my appearance of looking depressed, having that bizarre backstory. Therefore, I began living a lie for a while as I began this new school. 
Eventually feeling very conflicted; I realized I wished I never opened my mouth up at all. Especially since there was someone in my school who was a third cousin, who spread around to people that I had made up the whole story.  
I to some degree had now become a pariah to the student body. A self-inflicted wound that I visited upon myself solely for the purpose of fitting in. Boy did that backfire!  

Outward Bound
The summer finally came and now prompted by Michael; I was convinced to go on a month-long sailing camp called Outward Bound. This was a Youth Enrichment Service’s (YES) program that Michael was involved with where he got me a free scholarship to. 
This camp pitted inner city youths up weirdly with middle-class struggling executives in a character-building course meant to build confidence and self-esteem. It also gave me the much-needed break away from my party-happy friends back at home in Boston.  
We left on Friday morning and endured a four-hour bus ride where I witnessed firsthand an accident which claimed the life of the Jeep’s passenger that involved this jeep and an SUV. 
I saw the passenger of the Jeep go through the windshield as I awoke from my slumber on the back of our bus as I heard the sound of screeching brakes, followed by witnessing this guy die. 
Later we arrived at our port destination of Rockland Maine where we would assemble and eventually meet with our new crewmates. Our crew was a combination of 17-year old’s and about six older adults, two of which were crew leaders. 
I was somewhat dismayed by the fact that I would miss the YES concert back at Boston Garden that evening. As we boarded a 22’ long rowboat sailboat, Margret, a hot big-38 double D big breasted 36-year-old blue-eyed blonde-haired hottie told us to row.  
I sat there and began to row with three others in a team effort to pull ourselves out of the harbor. The wind had somewhat subsided, so our rowing power was needed to get us moving.  
As I distinctly remember starting to row, thinking how I would be missing my Yes concert that evening that I had tickets to, when Margret the team leader decided to strip her top off unceremoniously in the late June hot sun.  
Holy shit, damn did she have big nice tits. I sort of stood up for a brief moment to look at Margret’s beautiful D-breasts, when she assured me, this was all natural, that this was how life was meant to be. 
Ok, color me stupid right, but this day and age, she may even be considered some kind of weird pedophile for popping those beautiful girls out in front of a horny 17-year-old man like myself, but hey I wasn’t complaining.  
Her pretty smile and soft skin assured me however, this month-long Outward-Bound camp course would be freaking awesome, fuck the Yes concert I thought! 
Now under wind power beyond the safety of the calm sheltered harbor waters, we sailed right through sunset and eventually anchored off a tiny secluded island where we slept onboard the boat on top of our oars, in sleeping bags, while two had anchor night watch. 
The first night, I scooped this 17-year-old chick under the stars during my first watch, which in retrospect was a blast.  
We eventually made it to Hurricane Island up in Nova Scotia with stops along the way where we would run a couple of miles almost every morning, with me doing pushups, which got me the name of Rocky. 
What seemed weird to me, especially even today, is we would skinny dip in the ocean after our long runs. So, a group of us, ages 16-36-year-olds would strip down to nothing and swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean.  Hum nothing can go wrong here, right?
Having fully purged myself from marijuana and its complementary element of THC, I started to feel so much healthier. However, one night, two weeks into our journey, this girl from an accompanying boat got ahold of some truly potent Hawaiian Marijuana. 
We smoked, and I got so stoned that afternoon, that I started remembering what I had seen earlier that day on one of our hikes we had.  
I saw this hot woman with a gorgeous body, naked and up on what really looked like to me to be some kind of weird hippy tree house. 
She was exquisite I remember, how her naked hot silhouette and uncaring naked demeanor to us approaching stood out most in my mind.
Thinking of her throughout the day on the tree platform and now hours later, stoned and walking toward this tree-hut to sleep in, while at that exact moment still baked, I wondered to myself if this would be the day and I’d have another life-changing adventure with this hot naked woman and officially lose my virginity! 
I could not help but fantasize that I would be able to go up in this tree house and have sex with this very hot woman. As I climbed the latter some 12’up in the air, I was full of anticipation of meeting her and thought about what I’d say to her. 
I climbed my way up a 12-foot latter then entered the tented doorway and was immediately saddened to see not one, but like six people in sleeping bags spread out all over the floor.   
I was not going to get laid that night, something I fantasized about most of my life; instead, I would now have to stifle this lustfulness I had and just pass out on the damn wooden floor. What a crappy disappointment that was!  
So, Outward Bound involved many things, first it was a sailing school where we sailed 300 miles and a rope course, rappelling down cliffs, a seven-mile race, and a three-day survival mission on a secluded island and of course most of which I did sober too. 
On this three-day survival mission, we were supplied with a sleeping bag, 12 stick matches, a 10’ by 10’ plastic tarp, a gallon of fresh water, a cooking pot, a couple of old canned sea-rations, and my hidden stash of TP to keep me from having to wipe with sea-weed.  
As I parted from the drop-off boat onto a rubber dingy, my team leader instructed me to stay away from the endangered bird species that were recently reintroduced back into the wild by some conservationist, which were Ospreys. She also imparted the knowledge that there were also two wild rams on the island as well.  
Dropped off on Little Spruce Island by the dingy, I immediately canvassed the area for a place to set up my lean-to. I picked what I thought was a nice spot, in a green grassy area that was soft enough to sleep on. 
My first night there it rained lightly, but by now I was used to outdoor living and stayed relatively warm and dry.  
The second day I gathered firewood and used the bark of a birch tree, peeling the bark back exposing the dry part of it to use as kindling; then lit a warm camp-fire.  
Later that day I decided to go exploring the island and went to the south side of the island to see that my island at low tide attached to another island. 
I decided to climb down some cliffs to the beach below and as I crossed a small beach which was loaded with tons of shells and round sea rocks, I headed towards the other island.  
I made my way on the other side of the beach, climbed back up the cliffs on the other island and explored most of the adjoining island to find another Outward-Bound survivalist hiding from the drizzle in his dry lean-to tent.  
We chatted for some time and I decided it was time to head back to my island since it was misting. Now getting dark, still misting and the tide was rising quickly almost covering up the connecting beach completely, I made my move to get back toward Little Spruce Island before the tide enveloped the beach. 
As I got onto the cliffs ready to descend back down to the beach, I came upon those two rams my leader warned me about as I left the drop-off boat. 
They were set up on the beach apparently now guarding my route back to my island. I thought for a minute and decided to bombard them with rocks, eventually forcing them off the beach.  
Thinking my efforts to drive the rams off the beach worked or so it appeared, so I began climbing down the cliffs heading to the other side, realizing that the rams that had hid behind the rock inlet, now had spotted me and began charging at me running full tilt in my direction.  
I hastily retreated and climbed up the steep cliff formation just managing to out climb those two pissed off rams. As I quickly ascended the wet cliff formation, I slipped and fell forward on my chest, causing me to crush my prescription bottle I had in my front shirt pocket which kept my 12 stick matches dry.  
Because of this, the matches were now completely wet and unusable. It looked as though I may have to go the rest of the weekend without a fire since the damn rain also extinguished the one I light earlier. 
I now was caught on the other island and it was almost dark out, raining and I just wanted to go back to my lean-to. So, I restarted my vicious rock assault and bombarded the helpless rams off the beach-head. They soon retreated to my side of the island where I nervously went in search of my campsite. 
As I returned to my campsite, I began to notice there were many ram pellets scattered all over the green grassy area where I had pitched my tent. Fearing rams in the middle of the night would visit me; I slept with one eye open the rest of the night.  
Next morning was gorgeous, the sun shone brightly, and I was trying to decide what I was going to eat. I unfortunately however, had destroyed my matches in my hasty escape from my two pissed off rams.  
After a half hour of just sitting there contemplating my next move, I noticed a young woman in a sailboat, sporting a bikini, sailing by me some 100’ offshore.  
I waved to her repeatedly and eventually she sailed close enough, so I could talk to her. I told her my story as she laughed offering to help by sailing to her camp, delivering some dry Ohio Tipp matches to me. That was truly a lucky prophecy! 
Later that afternoon I saw a bunch of lobster traps just offshore in the icy cold Atlantic Ocean. I decided to risk swimming out to the traps and dove down to see if there were any lobsters to be found in them. 
Even though the first trap was empty, I decided to go swim out even further in that icy cold Novia Scotia water and dove down a little deeper in an area that had several other traps there. Pay-day, this time I found two baby lobsters in this one trap. 
I had to swim further out when I found the two lobsters and the first time I dove, I had to retreat to get more air. 
On the second dive I first couldn’t see how to open the trap. So, I dove a third time, this time opening up the trap grabbing the two babies by their necks and I began swimming frantically to the surface, holding each lobster in either hand. 
Getting out of breath from doing the breaststroke while the lobsters were in each hand, I nervously kept swimming as one of them bit my hand. 
I got to shore heaving them up on the beach, immediately re-grabbing them before they scampered away, and I let out a victorious scream as I now would be dining on lobster that night.  
Until that moment in life, I had never eaten lobster. Weird, since I was from Boston originally and had frequented Maine practically my whole life at my parent’s summer home. 
Getting back up the cliffs to my campsite, I then decided to kill my lobsters so they would not scamper away, since I had to go back down to the ocean with my pot and get some ocean water to cook my seafood in.
I then built a fire and cooked my catch. While eating this meal, I remember thinking how this meal was one of the best meals I had ever eaten in my entire life. All I needed was some beer, a baked potato and some sour cream and butter!
After getting back to the drop-off boat which picked me up on day four, I listened to how the rest of my boat mates survived eating periwinkles and what not. I then regaled them of the tale of my lobster tail. 
Overall, a great experience and I needed a break from growing up in Roslindale and the havoc of busing in the late 70’s was going on. But you get things when you least expect it and my parents guided Michael into getting me the scholarship to this program. It helped as I went through a change and grew from this experience although my tougher years were yet to come!



Chapter 3: Football Days and Rumble in Roxbury  
 
Playing football at White Stadium was a dream of mine when I was a kid. I was an Irish kid who arrived at Dudley Station in Roxbury wearing a Barracuda Jacket with four shamrocks sewn onto the collar. I was the only white player on an all-black team because of the forced busing era.  
Dad was the Athletic Director and he watched some of my games later the next year. At CM the year before, I was a wide receiver up until I tore all my ligaments in my right ankle after playing a pick-up football game after a CM football practice. 
During the rest of my junior year, now in my new school at a public school, I ran track to get into football shape for the next season and even pole vaulted after my move to this Public School after my ankle recovered. That year and into my senior year, I had gained twenty pounds from lifting weights.  
I played nose-tackle for Madison Park and although I was undersized for that position, I learned how to control bigger guys than me. One of my football coaches taught me to use speed, momentum and leverage of my opponent to my advantage. 
Later in life I learned the same principals while studying Kung-Fu and Ju-Jitsu and I actually was retaught these same techniques I learned as a smaller nose tackle.  
Although greatly outmatched by schools like Southie and East Boston, our team won half of its games because we had a great coach named Billy Allan. 
My coach liked me since I was from Roslindale and told me one day “Cronin you got the balls the size of a Cumquats!” A made-up thing of course, but he recognized I had balls and did not take anybody’s shit! 
The black football players wanted an all-black team, but I stood in their way. After practice one day, the quarter back stuck a twig in my ass because my underwear had a rip in them. 
You see back then the school closed early, and we changed on the field at Derby Park, right in the middle of Hispanic and Black projects. I even had a following of a couple of Black-Girls who loved to watch me get dressed.  
So, this dude, the quarterback stuck a twig in my underwear as I was changing and I didn’t take to kindle to it, so we started fighting. It turned a little too serious when I got on top and pushed his face into the ground, when a couple of the other players jumped in on top of me. 
But it eventually ended without too bad of an outcome. The quarterback just laughed at me but had a new found respect of me and knew I was tough. 
I got picked up that night by dad and I told him I wanted to quit the team. He did the right thing and talked me out of it. I found out later that he spoke to the team the next day, unbeknownst to me. 
They gave me the nickname “Crazy-White boy” after I started playing nuts and developed a tough reputation. Those guys actually were all pretty decent dudes I remember though! 
One day as I went into school coming in from the Boston Commons where my other school was located, getting off the old orange-line at Dudley station carrying my equipment in one hand and my helmet in my right hand, I had a run-in with close to thirty guys. 
This black kid ran past me and tried ripping my pads out of my left hand. I carried my pads and equipment in my left hand and my helmet in my right. He ran by me and tried pulling my bag out of my hand, so I pulled it back toward me and swung my helmet with my right hand directly bouncing it off his head, with a loud thud.  
During the bussing days there were race riots every other day. So, since I clocked this kid in an all- black neighborhood at Dudley station, I saw at least ten others scream as they all began chasing me. 
I was too quick though, so I outran them as they chased me all the way up to my teams pre-meeting game day planning room. The guys chasing me once they got inside the team’s room, realized these football players were all sticking up for me and they chased them out.  
I loved the opportunity I got to play at White Stadium in front of my dad. At the end of the season, I got recognized in a special banquet football dinner with the team at the end of the season where I got a trophy. 
The trophy was in recognition of a game against the first-place team, where I made seven solo tackles which kept the score close where we almost beat the number one public school football team that year over in West Roxbury, the town my dad was born in. 
During that game I had seven unassisted tackles and one football strip and fumble recovery where I ended up face down in the mud. 
Escorted to the sideline after recovering the football, someone took a towel and wiped out the mud off my face and out of my eyes. It was my dad, who I did not even know was in attendance that day. He was there for this game and that made me so proud!  
Later that year I ran track again and during my first run at pole-vaulting as I began the accent from the bent pole heading upwards, the damn thing snapped and I almost got impaled by the sharp broken half of the pole. Because I gained so much weight by working out, I was too heavy for that light-weight pole.       
Rumble in Roxbury
Well in high school I decided to invite the youngest O’Hearn along with me on a double date with some cute Irish chicks from Quincy. 
This meant we would be taking trains via the famed Orange line which had elevated parts built in the 1930’s and looked like an archaic old construct that gave it a sense of eeriness that very much fit into the dilapidated part of the city projects they hovered next to.  
Well, the date was fun as we went to a Led Zeppelin movie with the girls and we all had a good time. Of course, Thomas and I brought weed with us, which we tried sharing with our dates not realizing that they were not into getting high that much.  
Later we left the girls house after escorting them home, then taking the train back into Boston and once in Boston we transferred to the Orange line heading back toward our neck of the woods but through the heart of the city which contained projects and a high crime rate.  
At about North Hampton Street Station on the last train that night on the Orange Line sometime around 1 am that morning, I decided to pull a bag of weed out of my pocket and roll a joint with Thomas. 
       Just as the train rolled into North Hampton Station, about ten black dudes all piled into our train car, they all seemed as if they had been out partying all night as well.  
I quickly pocketed my weed before they saw me with it, but too late, this one younger guy saw me pocket it and he then approached me.  
He came up to me, sat down on my left, put his right arm around my neck, and said, “Hey buddy, what’s up?” 
As he spoke his left hand went into my pocket going for the ounce of weed I had just stashed. I reacted quickly since he was sitting beside me on my left, with someone else standing in front of me facing me and the other eight were all across from us, some sitting, some standing watching the commotion.  
Well, I decided to go for it! I took this kid’s arm out of my pocket, grabbing it with both hands and slammed it over my knee. I think I may have broken his wrist because he immediately screamed out in pain. 
A split second later, I attacked the dude in front of me, lifting him up between his legs in the air, slamming him into the Plexiglas train window, shattering it instantly.  
I turned and caught the next dude in mid-stride with a right boot to the balls and began to swing wildly at the onslaught of pissed off black youths coming at us. Thomas had already jumped up and hit another dude while he was attempting to swing at me, knocking him down. 
The riot was on! As we pulled into Dudley station, this one guy whipped a beer bottle at Thomas, but he saw it, ducked and it hit the train conductor right in the head, splitting his head wide open.   
The doors remained opened, since the conductor was on the ground and I somehow ended up on the platform at Dudley, a station I knew all too well from my football days. 
While I was fighting on the platform, swinging and kicking wildly, some kid tackled me from behind, taking out my legs with a great football tackle. Now on the ground they began taking turns booting me, surrounded by about six dudes, I reached into my pocket, pulled out a knife and began stabbing them in the shins and legs.  
They dispersed quickly from around me and I jumped up and now went on the attack. I began chasing them down the platform stairs, when Thomas followed me, grabbing me by my curly hair, and screamed, “Fucking Yule, what are you fucking doing, are you fucking crazy or something? 
He yanked me by the hair until I reached the train doors and got back on that damn train!” The conductor was cool, he waited for us and closed the doors as we returned on the train. 
Thomas was yelling triumphantly, and he noticed three big white construction workers who evidently watched the whole event. Thomas screamed, “Yule these fuckers watched us get jumped and didn’t even try to help us. 
He screamed at them calling them pussies as he got in their faces but we soon returned to our seats and smoked a joint to celebrate our rumble in Roxbury.
High school still had this one event that I had to live through. I was in physics class and there sat Bonny Litre the hottest girl in school and she was from South Boston too. 
I got high before class downstairs in the basement with other seniors and as we got into class our smoke made it into the vents of the classroom. Classy ha? 
Well, I must have dazed off too long and staired at Bonnie too long and as class ended, she said to me, Chris, I noticed you looking at me, do you want to go out sometime? 
  I immediately looked confused, but to not give it away I said sure. Do you want to go out during the weekend? 
She laughed hysterically at me and blurted out-loud “I’d never go out with you, you’re a fucking loser!” I didn’t have time to think, reeling back in pain I immediately said loudly, fuck you Cunt, I’d never go out with you either!” 
Just then Anthony Bono from the North End, sucker punched me as hard as he could, knock me backwards across the stairs. 
I immediately attacked him by lifting him up and back and charging him straight back into the metal hand rail. Threw a few more punches and then he stuck two fingers in my right eye. 
This through me into a rage. I picked him up and through him over the stair-rail up four floors and he grabbed onto the railing like a monkey. I began kicking his fingers and arms to try and knock him off so he’d fall the four floors, when another Ginny started throwing punches at me too. 
Michael Boleo a 6-2 265 tackle took my side and we fought to a standstill. I later got taken by a teacher to the hospital for my eye and missed a week because of the injury.  But what a fight! I’d say I won that one!   


Chapter 4: Creature Feature - Double Feature         
 
One night when I first met this guy Jimmy Creaser, or so I thought was the first night meeting him, we were all going down to the Jamaica Plain VA to the VA loony bin where they had locked Jimmy for God only knows what.   
But prior to this we at Billy J’s house smoking out of his 3’ tall Lebanese hash pipe. Smoking Lebanese hash!
 
We got so stoned when Billy J announced we would be leaving to drive down to the VA to meet up with one of Billy’s friends. As we left Billy’s house there were some Greek kids who were gathered outside. 
They had something in their hands and as I looked closer, I thought maybe a kids toy from something out of a Captain Crunch cereal box. 
This one kid came up to me and said with his Greek accent hey mister ever see a bee on a string? At first, I thought it was a prank, but all of a sudden, this damn bee flew within an inch of my eyes attached to a string. 
The bee just stood there staring right into my very stoned eyes and as I realized what it was, I freaked the fuck out and the kid chased me around the street with it as I was screaming, but still laughing!
After that we drove down the J-Way to go visit Jimmy Creaser. We had heard stories of this guy so I wanted to see this nut for myself! 
He was a 6’ tall, lean, absolutely insane looking, Vietnam Marine Core Veteran, who was from Charlestown Massachusetts, a town with a reputation for having crazy tough Irish guys in it. 
The guys from Charlestown or the Townies as they were known as, actually had the first fight with the British soldiers hundreds of years earlier, which resulted in the start of the Revolutionary War. He was a crazy bastard now residing at the Boston, Jamaica Plain VA mental ward located on the 13th floor of the VA hospital.   
Billy J, one of our older friends wanted to go down to JP and see this guy since he was one of Billy’s friends. We were formally introduced to him, while he sat there playing the piano like a concerto pianist, with a joint hanging out of his mouth, on Thorazine, but playing the piano like a famous virtuoso pianist.   
He was so out of it, stoned on Thorazine and openly smoking a joint in the patient mental ward. I thought to myself, “Oh my god, what an insane mother fucker, I can see why he is in the nuthouse!”
It didn’t click at the time, but actually, my first encounter with Jimmy was a few years earlier in Naples Maine. I was walking down route 302 smoking a joint at age 14 when all of a sudden, I saw a deputy sheriff’s uniform across the street. 
It turned out to be Jimmy Creaser in a county sheriff uniform, with the huge scary deputy hat with an even bigger gun saddled with his nightstick on his other hip.  
He yelled over to me and said ”hey what are you smoking?” I froze there immediately thinking I was going to be heading to jail. 
As he approached me from across route 302, I squeezed the joint in my right hand trying desperately to put it out before he came over as the joint burned my palm badly, but fear kept me from feeling any pain at that moment. 
He saw I was wearing my favorite blue Boston Public Schools football jersey on and remarked as he put his hand out to shake my hand, that he was from Charlestown, a part of Boston. I awkwardly shook with my left hand hiding the fact that in my right hand was a half lit joint. 
He said to me, “Boy that smells good, can I smoke some of that with you?” Now kind of in shock, we ended up smoking behind the old Mario’s Pizzeria right there in town. He looked at me with those insane blueish-red eyes and I just thought how very fucking weird the whole scene was.  
I told him I was from Roslindale another part of Boston, which oddly enough years later, I would be formally reintroduced to him at the Jamaica Plane VA hospital, a couple miles from Roslindale Square. 
But not ever putting it all together that I got high with him years earlier behind Mario’s pizzeria with him wearing a full sheriff’s uniform until I got to know of Jimmies history by hanging with him later on that this was the same guy. 
We would eventually hang out as friends for years together and at some point Ogg named us both “Creature feature double feature as I described one crazy weekend with Creaser in Maine!” 
Years later after the Mario’s pizza Sheriff pot smoking incident while with Tim, Joe and Jimmy O still in Naples, we were untying and launching the Songo River Queen adrift, with us on it, while we were intoxicated on marijuana, beer, with Timmy and Joe tripping. We had eventually been caught by a Sherriff, who Tim thinks was Jimmy Creaser.  
He had driven us back to our campsite, letting us go with a chuckle. Jimmy; rumor had it, was fired off the Sherriff departments force for shooting a suspected drunk driver in the head, killing him instantly.  
As the story goes, I think Jimmy had planted a gun on him and said the drunk driver he pulled over had aimed it on him, so he shot him in self-defense. 
They threw him off the force immediately suspecting, but never proving the theory that Jimmy killed him not in self-defense, as Jimmy insisted, but they never could prove Creaser killed him outright. 
Jimmy was suicidal too! One night while driving his speed boat full throttle, he intentionally smashed his boat right into the rock jetty on the landing at Naples Causeway on route 302. 
This was in the same town right across the street where I first met him, and smoked weed at Mario’s Pizza place years earlier, also right down from the street from the Songo River Queen which we stole and where my parents camp was too.  
He just hit the Causeway jetty wall at the end of Long Lake and launched himself clear across the busy route 302, not even getting hurt, right in front of Rick’s Cafe, unbelievable weird voodoo luck he had I’ll tell you what!  
There also happened to be another true Jimmy story. One night while he was with Gangue Greely and two others, he had another suicidal urge. 
This time he convinced Greely to let him drive, when he purposely drove Tom’s car 90 mph in a ragtop Cutlass Oldsmobile convertible with three passengers in it, eventually crashing into a huge oak tree, throwing all four passengers into snow banks on the side of the road.  
Tom drove me to the wreckage to show me the car which was so bad; the aftermath of the crash left the car ripped in three equal parts. It looked as if no one could have ever survived it. However, all four did. He had some kind of weird Voodoo luck about him, I’ll say again! 
My new high school was located downtown near the Boston Commons next to the combat zone. Creaser found out I went to school there in my senior year which was around the early spring. 
We began hanging down the commons and we partied smoking weed and drinking beer, as he talked me into cutting school with him many, many days. One day with Jimmy, we got beer and smoked more weed and partied until about noon.  
Later as we began walking toward Tremont Street still on the Commons; when all of a sudden, Jimmy sees this black guy hanging out with four other dudes wearing a huge thick gold chain with a boom box jamming to some disco crap. He kind of looked like God damn Mr. T.
Jimmy decided it was a good idea to sneak up on this guy, whose back was toward us and pick up a 50-gallon drum park barrel next to the bench. Like a mad man raising it over his head he clocked the dude right off the noggin, dropping him instantly. 
The kid went down like a brick hitting the ground with a thud. Now the other four dudes began chasing us through the Commons with us heading toward the Boston Gardens part of the Commons. 
We had run so quickly and lost all but one of them, who remained on our tail, when Jimmy said, “Yule stop, Lets beat this prick’s ass!”  
Well, the dude just did catch up to us unfortunately for him, because Jimmy and I tuned him up pretty good sending him on his way limping with a swollen eye, after I tackled him to the ground and Jimmy booted him in the face.  
He scampered away wondering “WTF,” running away from us now with a distinct limp, with those now in style low-riding jeans down around his knees, just another day hanging around with crazy Creaser! 

Hitchhiking to Sebago Lake, Creaser style!

One hot late spring night in 1977, Jimmy and I decided to hitchhike to Sebago Lake in Maine, since we both had our own connections with the area. We started up route 1 outside of downtown Boston in Charleston on the North side of the Tobin Bridge heading eventually to Maine via the Maine back roads. 
While we were getting various short rides, which put us closer to our destination, we were smoking some very potent Columbian Gold weed.
We got a ride by this one guy with his newlywed wife who was driving a 20-year-old station wagon, with “Just Married” sprayed on the back window in shaving cream. 
We got in and this guy was happy to see us and said, ”Hey it’s my honeymoon, get in, I’ll give you guys a ride.” We got in and relit our joint, which we then passed around the car.  
While enjoying smoking the weed we had with us, the driver pulled a bottle of Jack and downed three quarters of it, and simultaneously punched the gas to get our speed up over 70 mph. 
I was stoned, very nervous and saw how the roof of this station wagon was bolted on by rivets, which now began vibrating and jumping around loosely, and looked like it might just fly off the car at any moment because of the speed we were driving. 
As the car raced down the dark country road, I watched the trees fly by me very quickly, which clued me into just how fast we were moving. I got nervous, and said to Jimmy, “Tell this idiot to slow down!”  
Jimmy nervously grinned and yelled, “Hey bro slow down!” He did not listen at all and even started driving faster, so I said to Jimmy again, “Tell this fuckhead to slow down now will you!?” 
Jimmy; all of a sudden, pulled a hatchet out of his duffle bag, grabbed the driver’s new bride by her hair, pulled her backwards toward the back seat, and screamed, “Slow down or I’ll cut her fucking head off!” 
The intoxicated driver immediately jammed the brakes on, launching me against the back of the driver’s seat, while Jimmy was propelled up onto the dashboard, cracking the windshield with his head as the car skidded to a sudden halt. 
The driver immediately pulled out a tire iron from beside his seat, and attempted to swing it across his body to hit Creaser with it.  
I saw this happening in what seemed to me to be in slow motion and from behind him, I immediately grabbed the tire iron from him in mid swing, pulling it straight back across his throat, choking him out, while Creaser began yelling, “I’m going to kill this fucking bitch!” 
Instantly I shrieked, “Jimmy no, don’t do it, let’s just get the fuck out of here!” As we left, Jimmy turned around and screamed, “Do the fucking car Yule!”   
He began hitting the car with his hatchet, breaking glass and puncturing the roof, as I just stood there beside the open back door with the tire iron still in my hand, in total shock.  
Jimmy repeatedly smashed the car windows as it started to speed away. Now dumped out in the middle of nowhere in the Maine pucker, shaking and Jimmy screaming triumphantly, the car pulled away into the frenzied, bizarre summer night. 
With me now shaking on the side of the road, Jimmy then walked over and sat down on a nearby bridge guardrail overlooking a retention pond beneath us where I followed. 
Jimmy lit another joint and laughed about the insane episode we had just lived through. I shared my thoughts with Jimmy as I began thinking in a very paranoid state of mind and said, “Hey what if this guy comes back after us and is packing?” 
All of a sudden like as if we were in a Steven King novel, I heard what sounded like a car engine reverberating in the near distance. 
Then I saw one headlight shoot through the dark, foggy, backwoods country road, illuminated by a dimly lit streetlight, portraying a spine-chilling scene of a car speeding around the bend back toward us.   
I screamed, “Oh shit,” and witnessed Creaser jump up and take off like a lightning bolt, flying down the embankment toward the pond below, which I more than willingly followed him instantly running down the steep hill too, as fast as I could.
Now hearing the car screech to a halt and hearing the door slam shut, I turned my head around as I continued running down the steep embankment. 
Things seemed to be happening again now in super slow motion since I was so stoned as I witnessed the first flash from the muzzle-shot of his pistol aimed directly at me some eighty feet away. I do not ever remember hearing the first gunshot blast at all since I was so petrified.  
As I turned back again a second time nearing the bottom of the embankment, I watched him fire at me again.  The cold retention pond water was now at my feet causing me to be fully alert as I lost one of my sneakers in the thick muddy water and tried desperately to escape running in this thick muddy bog.  
The second shot boomed through the thick Maine air, as I simultaneously saw the muzzle flash again and thought, “Oh my god, I’m going to get fucking shot, WTF!” 
When I finally made it to the edge of the woods running full tilt, Jimmy out of nowhere grabbed me from behind a tree pulling me to safety behind a large oak, as I watched Jimmy laugh uncontrollable as if he was really enjoying the total insanity of that moment. 	
We stood there behind this huge oak and continued hearing the echoes of the pistol booming along with hysterical screams and taunts from the newlywed groom throughout the nighttime woods. 
We stood there 200 feet or so in the safety of the dense woods, me with one sneaker on, both legs soaking and shaking like a leaf. The newlyweds had apparently gotten their revenge, satisfyingly getting back into their car and leaving as if nothing ever had happened. 
Not over yet, we eventually made our way back on the road some 10 minutes later and actually managed to flag down another unsuspecting driver in a van. We straightaway suspected he was gay and got in the van with him anyways. 
Jimmy again pulled the hatchet out again; scaring the shit out of this poor guy and told him he was now going to drive us some 35 miles out of his way to bring us to Sebago Lake where we were heading.  
On top of this, since I had only one sneaker on, Jimmy made this poor man give me his loafers, which although were a little too small for me, I managed to get through the rest of our journey wearing them.
As we got into Standish Maine, Jimmy and I departed quickly without harming our nervous driver and found the road, which took us up to Douglas Mountain. Since it was late June, the blackflies were all over us, flying into our eyes, nose, mouth and hair. 
Jimmy took a tee shirt out of his bag and put it over his head, using one of the armholes to look out from, which I copied. Consequently, the only visible thing on our heads was our eyes sticking out from our white tee shirts making us look like some crazy fucking KKK dudes! 
We made it to his brother’s cabin in the woods near Douglas Mountain and we went inside where Jimmy talked with his brother. Jimmy came in from the other room sporting a Mossberg Shotgun and a 357 Magnum pistol, which according to Jimmy would be our new hunting armaments. 
We left his brother’s house and ended up climbing halfway up Douglas Mountain where Jimmy and I decided to camp that night, still wearing our makeshift black fly tee-shirt masks.  
Jimmy was an ex-marine, ex-Vietnam Veteran who knew something about living in the wild. He had me chop down some green pine branches with his hatchet to form a lean-to over an existing tree branch. We tried sleeping but this stubborn Whip poor will, kept whip poor willing for over an hour straight.  
Eventually as I started snoozing, Jimmy out of the blue, fired the damn Mossberg up into the heavily treed canopy. I jumped from a dead sleep, waking up fully in seconds, especially given the fact that earlier that night I had been shot at several times. When hanging with Jimmy Creaser, there was never a dull moment! 
Making it back into Roslindale four days later as I smoked a joint with Ogg, I told him of my Creaser adventures where he laughed hysterically at me. We smoked another joint and he of course coined a new nickname for Creaser and me, which was “Creature Feature-Double Feature!” 
Jimmy being a torn, insane man who had a pension for causing mischief, lived life as if it were his last day on earth. Talking recently to my brother Timmy, he mentioned that he had seen an obituary years earlier on Jimmy Creaser around 1996.  
I thought to myself, “It would be just like Jimmy to fake his own death to avoid prison time or someone he owed a ton of money to.” In a weird way, I hope this is true, hard to fathom Jimmy being really dead, or I actually wonder if by some odd chance I will run into him again in some insane fashion. If you are dead Jimmy, RIP Bro! “See you in the next world and don’t be late!”


Chapter 5: Growing up with Crazy Friends
 
The O’Hearn’s were a family who originally came from Ireland that immigrated to Boston in the early 60’s. Chris was the oldest male who served in the 101’st airborne and fought during the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. He earned a silver star one night in Vietnam when he was on point on a search and destroy mission.   
The Viet Cong let the point pass through to ambush the main body of the platoon behind them and a fierce firefight ensued. Chris wounded right off, managed to fight back effectively with his two other wingmen from the backside, effectively creating a two-sided counter-offensive.  
The battle raged on for eight hours and Chrissy ended up roaming gook infested jungles with a few survivors for a couple of days. During this battle there was even some hand-to-hand combat. The counter-offensive worked to some degree as some of the Rangers managed to kill more Viet Cong than were killed themselves.  
Chris that night earned a Silver Star and a Purple Heart medal in the battle, eventually getting two more Purple Hearts from other scrapes he had been in while also catching a bad case of Malaria, which almost killed him as well. 
I just loved hanging out hearing him tell stories and kind of considered him my de-facto big brother. When I was 13, I was first introduced to the O’Hearn’s and befriended them when John O’Hearn and Ogg, guys my own age, came up to me in the Arboretum in Roslindale and asked if I had any weed. 
My friend and I; Jimmy O’Connor had just rolled some joints and had them stashed in a Sucrets can. John, Ogg, Jimmy and I got high and argued about our street hockey rivalry we had going over the years. 
    
I sold them a couple of joints for later use as we sat up on Motley Hill, our favorite part of the Arboretum where we later would hang out many times over in the future.  
The Arnold Arboretum is the largest tree museum in the world and is owned by Harvard University. It was the best party place in Boston. 
The “Arbs,” as we affectionately called it, had Revolutionary gravesites where we proudly guarded them against vandals who at times would try to desecrate these historic stones with their gothic handwritten homage chiseled on them.  
These graves were right behind my house which led to many attempted séances where we fool- heartedly tried communicating with the soldier spirits. 
It was in the heart of the city but looked like a groomed forest far away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Boston. We felt extremely safe partying up there since we had camouflage from the police by the thick treed canopy. 
Meeting them that day up there started a life-long friendship that entangled our paths for many years to come.  
My brother Tim who himself at that time had pounds of Mexican pot would sell bags of weed in the early days to John and Ogg. They would always ask me to sell them pot from Tim’s stash too, because I would bring them out four finger nickel bags. 
He eventually found out and screamed at me to stop, but I never really did! To sneak the weed in the house, Timmy would go downstairs and close the curtains in the dining room and my parent’s bedroom. He would go out into the backyard, have me drop a rope out from the attic window and he would tie on a large garbage bag filled with pounds of weed. As I then quickly hauled up his cache. 
Since we both lived up in the attic, bringing it in without being caught; we had to come up with a full proof ingenious method or risk dad murdering us. 
We would sneak it in by pulling it up from the backyard into the attic, where Timmy had a scale and baggies to break up the pounds. I remember one-day dad found Timmy’s scale and baggies in the attic and kicked Timmy’s ass for dealing weed. 
He grounded Tim by making him go to work with dad at White Stadium which would actually be the beginning of Timmy’s half life-long career working in the Boston public school’s system around White Stadium and at the other Boston Public area schools.
One day, Chris O’Hearn walked down to Mendum St. in front of my house and asked me if I wanted to walk down to the arbs gate to get high. Of course, I said yes, and we walked into the arboretum and began smoking this one joint. 
Chrissy smiled at me and warned me, “This weed Yule is some of the strongest weed on the planet,” he said. He called it, “Colombian Point Rojas.” 
As we began smoking, I noticed a nice relaxing buzz coming on, kind of like Hawaiian weed felt like. 15 minutes later Chrissy asked me how I liked it. I said, “Oh, it’s nice, but I’m not that stoned yet.” He laughed and said, “Give it a few minutes Yule.”  
Well 15 minutes later, I was so stoned; I remember rolling around the grass in the arbs, laughing my ass off. Holy shit was I stoned. Apparently, this Colombian weed was a slow rising kind of weed that took some time to feel its full effects. 
I was so stoned as we left the arbs, heading up Ogg’s street and watched Chrissy with a joint hanging out of his mouth and watched him get into a conversation with Ogg’s farther. Ogg’s father probably figured it was regular cigarette not wacky tobacki. Jesus Chrissy was fucking nuts! 
As I began hanging out with John, I learned that the brothers ran a lucrative business-supplying weed to much of the Northeast region of the country and surrounding Boston suburbs. 
They brought Colombian weed in routinely where they distributed it all over the Northeast. I found out later that they met Colombians in boats and would bring in hundreds of bales of weed at a time. As a result, we always had some of the most potent types of weed on earth and regularly smoked with John up in the Arbs.  
So basically, it was John, Ogg, Jimmy and I who were all inseparable, hanging out all the time up the arbs or in my basement in the winter, playing pool, ping-pong or table hockey, usually with me kicking ass in pool and being really competitive with John in ping-pong. 
John never talked about it all that much, but he was heavily involved in his brother’s business and eventually you just picked up things as we hung around him.  
Meeting Chris through John was cool! He was such a badass dude who could role a joint in his truck with one hand while he was driving. Kind of like a cool John Wayne on horseback, sort of speaking. 
One night I remember Chrissy came over to Roslindale and we got high. I was on my way to meet this chick named Nancy Slutler as we referred to her as. I was involved with Nancy and was a woman I used to get laid with when I was home from the service leave with!
So, I invited Chrissy to come with me. He talked me into getting Nancy and her young girlfriend to drive to Duxbury Beach that night and camp out on the beach under the stars. 
Since I brought Nancy with her girlfriend, I think Chrissy just naturally assumed we would party with these girls and have sex with them.  
As we got to the beach, he did something that scared her, and she locked herself in Chrissy’s truck with his keys inside the truck. Before the drive down to Duxbury, Chris gave me a hand-full of downers and I chased them down with a couple of beers. 
I remember; just vaguely, setting up the tent on the beach that night on the beach. We were still drinking and getting high, and now, it was just the three of us, since the other chick locked all of us out of the truck and would not come out whatsoever.  
Well, I remember going to sleep with Nancy on my right in my sleeping bag, with Chrissy on her right. I passed out and slept right through the night. When I woke up in the morning, she was naked and in Chrissy’s sleeping bag and I am sure Chrissy banged her that night.  
When I woke up, dummy Chrissy had pitched the tent to close to the water. The bottom 2’of the tent was in about 6” of water. I slid out of the tent quietly as they slept and to get back at him for fucking my slutty girlfriend, I collapsed the tent poles and lifted the bottom watery side of the tent, which got them soaking wet. 
Of course, I ran away down the beach laughing like a little bitch, because I didn’t want crazy Chrissy to catch up to me and kill me. 
What’s funny about that I guess, is Chrissy caught spiral meningitis from that bitch and had a painful procedure involving a needle stuck in his spine to relieve the swelling. 
Ogg and I laughed at him once we found out and said, “It serves him right,” behind his back of course. This was just another typical stupid adolescent memory of hanging with this crazy bastard!
Story had it; that even Whitey Bulger tried getting a piece of the family action that they had going on, but they just told him to fuck-off. Rumor had it, that there were threats against the family, but Chrissy somehow convinced Whitey to back off. 
Thugs came to K street in Southie only to be met by Chrissy firing a shotgun round off directly over their heads. Things blew up and Whitey got the message. 
The O’Hearn’s were not going to share anything with that rat. Of course; later on, everyone heard how Bulger was an FBI informant. I wonder if he ratted on the family and if that eventually got them all caught. 
When we called the house, we never mentioned anything to do with drugs at all. John at this time had found out they were being phone tapped and were under investigation.  
Pretty sure of the time-line, as I remember being down Cape Cod hiding out with my future wife because it was during this time I had run away with my parents’ best friends’ son’s wife. 
While together down the Cape, while still hiding from my parents’, she held up a newspaper and I saw splashed on the front page of the Boston Globe in detail explain how the DEA raided a sailboat and that something like 354 bales of weed were confiscated.  
Considered a record seizure of weed at the time, the paper went on to mention how Patrick, “The Weed King-Pin of New England,” was being sought by DEA and FBI agents, and how at the time he was on the run for a marijuana dealing empire that stretched back like ten years or so or the entire time I hung out with them.  
John and Chrissy were also mentioned in the raid as they were pinched unloading bails from the sail-boat and got caught during the nighttime raid. 
I know John and Chrissy both did at least three years. I do know more of what happened, but will not mention anything else, other than Pat getting something like seven years. They did their time, but made millions, and became legends to the many people who knew them growing up in Boston. 


Chapter 6: Coast Guard Dangerous?
 
Bootcamp was interesting to say the least! I arrived on July 19 on a foggy night in Cape May, New Jersey. As I got off the bus, I was greeted by 6 overzealous Drill Sergeants waiting as they said, “Here comes the new raw meat!”   
Immediately they started barking out orders and screaming at us and within minutes, they had us on the ground, doing pushups. Here I was, head shaven by Jimmy Creaser, patchy and all, looking like I had some kind of mange growing. I dropped to the ground and began doing one-hand pushups.  
My son recently went through boot camp himself and I told him to always keep a low profile with the drill sergeants. I should have taken my own advice some 20 years prior, when I was in the same situation as he was. 
As I got to around 20 one hand pushups, they noticed me and all gathered around me. Holy crap did they scream at me! One sergeant said, “Oh look what we got here, a tough guy!” Well, the benefits of keeping a low profile didn’t dawn on me whatsoever, until I now had way too much of their attention, which would last throughout my extended, boot camp visit. 
First week of boot camp was insane! That summer, right before I left for camp, I partied my ass off, drank and smoked a ton of strong Columbian weed from my buddies while at home. 
As the second week started, I got really shaky from withdrawing from all the alcohol and pot I smoked the previous month. Well, given that my nerves were now fried starting this third week, from withdrawals brought on by a sudden total, complete withdrawal of the six previous years of extremely hard partying, I was not able to handle what came next.  
This tough looking black drill sergeant got right up in my face and screamed at me, “Hey boy, what’s the matter with you? You miss mommy and daddy or something?” 
He continued, “Hey boy, I’m gonna fuck your mommy in the ass and make her scream, what you gonna do about it?” Well holy shit, that was it, I flew into a rage and as hard as I could I booted that bitch in the shins with my steel tipped toed Boon Dockers on.  
He went down so quick, I jumped forward at him and tried to swing, but instantly, I had three of them, who instantly pulled me off of him, and had my arms behind me in a full nelson and my face was now on the ground with now all four of them flipping out at me. 
Minutes later, they got off of me, but now since I did break down, I was now in deep shit. I was removed immediately from the parade grounds and escorted away from my company. 
On the way to my now new home, I was met by Senior Chief Bass who pulled me out of this new group I was put into and said this to me, “Cronin you’re in so much trouble, you fucked up bad son. Here’s what’s going to happen now. 
We are putting you in motivation platoon for two weeks. You can either struggle through your next two weeks and join another company behind you or be a pussy and drop out, it’s up to you!”  
He further went on and he said, “Cronin I like you, you got balls! If you do make it through the next two weeks, I’ll personally see to it you make it through the rest of boot camp!” Well, that’s all I needed. But holy shit the next two weeks sucked! 

Motivation platoon was a bunch of hotheads, misfits and confused recruits who were only one-step from being sent home with a dishonorable discharge. Everywhere we went we had to double time it.  Basically, that meant running everywhere we went. We had to do pushups and sit-ups constantly. 
At the chow hall we were only allowed ten minutes to eat, as we had to endure screaming drill sergeants in our face constantly. I think even today I eat my food way too fast for this very reason.
I remember double-timing it to chow for lunch. It was July 31 and it was my birthday, when while waiting to file into the lunch hall, I was singled out of line and made to do pushups in a puddle until I couldn’t do anymore. I think I actually did something like 75 pushups when I was told to lie in the puddle and swim like a fish.  
Well, I did what I was told and got completely soaked from the rainwater, which had fallen the night before. After my swim time, I was allowed into the chow hall and ate, as this dick sergeant screamed the worst vulgar things in my face as I swallowed my food whole in big lumps, I thought, “Damn this is fucking miserable!” 
Still wet we filed into an air-conditioned class where we had to endure some damn class that lasted over an hour. After we had to go change finally and go to PT at the track where we ran for hours while taking breaks to do pushups in 90-degree summer heat. Oh, the joy and Happy Fucking Birthday!!!!!!!  
The next day I remember double timing to chow when I just stopped and barfed all over the parade ground. I was now shaking and vomiting all over and told to report to sick hall. Two days later I rejoined my motivation squad for more fun, yeeha!!! 
One night in motivation-platoon in the middle of the night, like 3:30 in the morning, we got suddenly awakening by drunk drill sergeants who came into our barracks and bounced a trashcan off the wall. 
They screamed profanity at us for all of us to get up and put our boots on and get our drill piece, a vintage A1 wooden drill rifle they still used for drill practice, these pieces were rifles that were used in World War 2 but now used for ceremonial marching pieces. 
Still in our underwear we had to lineup outside on the parade grounds. The moon was full and so were our Drill sergeants, full of alcohol. They were brutal that night and began making us run up and down the parade field wearing just our boots and underwear. 
We had to run with our piece at highpoint, which for your non-service types meant above our heads while occasionally being told to get down for pushups.  
This went on for two hours at which point we were dismissed back into the barracks for shaves and showers. They called it hell night, followed by hell day, where 8 of the 20 left in the platoon and were escorted that day to be summarily dismissed with a dishonorable discharge and sent back home.  
I made it through unscathed and determined to complete my training. Another week of craziness went by and I was put with my new company, which was Lima Company 101. After motivation was over, I began having fun. They were much easier on us or at least much easier than those two previous weeks had been!  
Later on, as we were halfway through the 11th drill phase week, me having an extra two for good behavior, I started having fun. I loved doing pushups and could do more than anyone in camp. 
Sit-ups and running were enjoyable to me as well. During the 8th week, we were timed on our 1-mile run. I finished first that day out of 300 hundred recruits, with a time of just under 5 minutes.  
Two weeks later, we were timed for the 2-mile run, where I came in third. Between the firing range on the 8th week and galley week during the ninth, I had a lot of fun. 
Galley week was a week where our company took a turn at cleaning the mess hall for that week, and it became entertaining for all of us, when after one of our nights of cleaning, we were supposed to self-march ourselves back to the barracks to wash up and get ready for the next day.  
As we self-mustered and began marching the ½ mile march back to our barracks. I started chanting the chorus that the monkey soldiers from the iconic movie, “The Wizard of Oz,” were chanting all while stomping my boon-docker the one time at the end of each verse of this strange monkey soldier chant, just as the soldiers had done in this favorite childhood movie I grew up faithfully watching every year when I was little. 
This caught on and with close to 60 guys now joining in with our coordinated stomping and singing, at the end of the verse of, “Yo we oh, yolo; Yo we Oh, yolo,” “Stomp.” Yola. We kept this chant and subsequent boot stomp loudly and methodically as had been depicted in the movie all those years earlier. 
Our chanting and our coordinated stomp could be heard all over the entire boot camp base of Cape May, New Jersey. Something I will never forget! 
 	The 10th weekend we had liberty in Wild Wood New Jersey, a kind of seashore theme park where we could eat, drink and sleep. Oh, hell yah we had a blast! I can say without a doubt that I enjoyed boot camp for the most part and glad I made it through. 
My company would finish their 11-week boot camp training and I finished my 13, 2 more weeks for good behavior of course for me.   
Liberty weekend on our ninth week was amazing; we left on a Friday night and allowed to leave until the following Monday morning. Wild Wood was close by, so we all went there for our liberty weekend. 
Immediately leaving the base, we all booked hotel rooms and got cab rides from the waiting throng of cabbies and went to dinner after we checked in, followed by a long shower in our hotel room.  
Afterwards my buddy Peter Todd and I; with some others, went out to the board walk, bought six cases of bear and a ton of ice and stored them in the bathtub which was full of ice, “Priorities right!?”  
We also bought several of those Styrofoam coolers, filled it up with beer and ice, walked across the boardwalk down to the seashore, started partying, and eventually got drunk under the boardwalk.  
Eventually we met up with a bunch of local chicks and partied with them, having to make several beer-runs back to our room to reload our coolers. 
I remember this cute chick which I hit on and began making out with, later dared the few of us left, to jump into the ocean naked. Drunk, horny and having hopes of getting laid, I accepted their challenge and took of my clothes and jumped into the Atlantic Ocean. 
The two other guys I was with followed suit. All of a sudden after swimming in the cold Atlantic Ocean which sobered me up a little, I noticed the girls had disappeared. 
I ran out of the water across the beach, naked, cold and now soaking wet and I headed back under the board walk to notice the girls and our clothes were now all gone. 
They had taken our clothes, cooler, shoes, and wallets and ran off with them. Drunk, embarrassed and now totally pissed, I contemplated how I was going to cross the damn boardwalk and get to my room, naked as a j-bird. Holy shit this sucked!  
From having a blast to now even thinking I might even get laid with this cutie, to then having the realization these bitches stole our shit and were now; I bet, watching us as a bunch of streaking idiots who now had to run across the damn boardwalk was deflating to say the least! 
I bet they were all perched somewhere, laughing their asses of at us; needless to say, it was fucking embarrassing, but still a very good prank, Kudos bitches!!!
The three of us made it across the street, but while crossing the street, naked and embarrassed, somebody leaned on their car horn to accentuate our dire predicament. 
We eventually got back to the hotel room and began hammering on the door to our room which we then had to listen to Peter laugh hysterically at us, who called us all a bunch of fucking idiots! 
So, I got dressed again, went back out, eventually found my clothes and shoes in a garbage can along with my wallet, minus the $150 bucks in cash I had in it. 
Geez, what the hell, these bitches played us so damn good! They probable did this every week to a new bunch of different, dumb, idiot recruits, probably making it their Friday night ritual every weekend, with new recruits that besieged Wildwood New Jersey.  
Weeks later on graduation day, with the anticipation of finally going home for 10 days of leave was first and foremost on my mind. My parents had driven down from Boston to watch me graduate. I had made it! However, two more things I hadn’t anticipated happening happened that final day.  
One: My drill Sergeant and his buddy made me get down one more time in front of all the anxious parents, to do one more set of pushups. That wasn’t so bad I made it right? 
What I didn’t like doing however was to have to get on my back; mind you in my dress uniform and do a set of sit-ups. Of course, this got me dirty in my graduation dress blues which my parents would see me in, but oh well, “Whatever it’s over” I thought, ”I finally made it!”
But after the ceremony we were all mustered up one more time and we were awarded our first duty station, mine being on Governors Island, a station only known to me as being in New York Harbor. 
I was to report twelve days later to the Coast Guard Cutter Sauk. Before being released for the last time from boot camp and given our leave, I was greeted one more time by my Drill Sergeant and his buddy.  
His friend came up to me, said with a grin on his face, “Congratulations Cronin, you made it” and went to shake my hand.

His friend came up to me, said with a grin on his face, “Congratulations Cronin, you made it” and went to shake my hand. 
As I began shaking his hand, he quickly jerked my arm and hand between my legs. Apparently, this was a judo move he knew all too well, then grabbed my hand, now in-between my legs, then pulled up hard, using his two hands which made me do a flip, where I landed on my back. 
Now totally confused I started thinking, “What a dick,” right? You suck asshole I thought to myself! But he way I started bootcamp doing one-hand pushups and being an idiot and doing the opposite of keeping a low profile, perhaps I deserved some of these parting shots!


Chapter 7: Nightmares on the Cutter Sauk

Well, my first duty station was going to be on the Cutter Sauk in New York harbor. We would have a lot of responsibilities including icebreaking up on the Hudson River in the winter, a river that was essential in getting vessels to take and bring commerce, including fuel and garbage barges and anything else crucial to supporting the infrastructure to the state capital of New York, Albany. 
The first day on the Sauk I remember walking up the gangplank onto my new duty station, a 110’ tugboat and was introduced to my crew of about 26 guys. Most of the higher rank officers and Petty Officers were older white men ages 30 and up.  
The crew; most of which were between 19 and 24, were black guys who were raised in New York as well as neighboring New Jersey towns to our south. I walked onto the Sauk at lunch and was met immediately by a raucous chat of boot, boot, boot!  
I knew immediately I was now in another space, time and dimension in my young unexperienced life. I wondered then and to this day still wonder how I ended up on a boat in New York City, with practically every big black guy in the Coast Guard stationed on my new unit. 
If I had been stationed on either side of the Sauk, on either tug next to me, life would have been quite different. The neighboring boats had all white crews, some of who I became friends with over the next couple of years with.
Judging from the size of these guys, I realized; although I was pretty tuff kid myself, that I was at a distinct disadvantage because of the number and size of these guys. 
They were all x-football players like me, athletes, who were in excellent shape. I had lived through a previous experience of being outnumbered by black guys before, due to the fact that I was the only white guy on a black football team which was located in the heart of Roxbury, where we practiced on a field surrounded by inner city projects. 
Here I was again, but this time I couldn’t go home every night as was the case. Now home for me really sucked!
My Commanding Officer a Warrant Officer from Georgia who I suspect was a racist, set the climate of the crew’s animosity. He seemed to delight in giving these guys restricted shore-leave in a way to needle the black crew. 
The white Chiefs and higher-ranking Petty Officers all got to leave at night to their own apartments on base, some with wives, others without. So, the unfair treatment these guys received would reverberate back down to me all the time.
Generally, the black guys were pissed off at the conditions and found that having a white boy, a Bostonian to boot, as the low man on the totem pole suited them fine. I was the odd man out. The birthing area at night was full of these dudes that I had nothing in common with, who were always loud and obnoxious. 
They made it clear that they didn’t like me, in many threatening remarks they made a point of making to me at the beginning of my first couple of weeks on board.
One night I had just returned to New York coming from Boston on liberty and drove the four-hour ride back to the boat. I had arrived at 4:30 that morning, went to bed for 2 hours and awoke 20 minutes before the early morning muster to grab a shower. 
Somehow that day, I got into some kind of trouble by my first-class Boatswain’s mate, who gave me some stupid punishment for not cleaning the galley food vent that had not been cleaned in over a year.  
I now had to do extra duty that night for punishment which involved, sweeping, washing and waxing the birthing area floor while the crew was away playing basketball in the inner island league that played a couple times a week.  
The six of them came back all at the same time down the birthing room ladder, into the now still wet floor in the birthing area not even breaking stride right across the wet waxed floor. I was pissed! 
The work to the floor, which took me over two hours, was now ruined and was a huge mess. Moe, the x-high school quarterback lashed out at me and asked what the fuck I was doing. 
I told him of my punishment assignment, as I stood in front of his metal framed rack. He screamed, “Clean this shit up now and get the fuck out of here.” I looked at him, dismayed, tired, aggravated and said to him, “Fuck you mother fucker.”   
As I bent over to pick up my bucket to leave, he sucker-punched me as hard as he could to the back of my head. 
I was knocked to the floor, hitting my head on the half-full bucket and it spilled all over the floor. Within a split second, I jumped up into him driving him upwards back into the corner of his bed frame, kneeing him in the balls and throwing him to the floor, and began pounding his face. 
The others in the room, three of the brothers which jumped on me, began punching me and pulling me off him, landing a few punches of their own to my face and head. 
Moe got back to his feet and I was trying to recover myself from the barrage I just received. We fought on for a couple of minutes again with me ending up on top again. 
They just rolled me off him and we kept fighting. A petty officer had come to my assistance and temporarily stopped the fight. 
Then Moe grabbed a dog wrench off the bulkhead and started swinging at me. I escaped up the birthing room ladder, up into the next deck, ran into the galley and found a butcher knife in the galley waiting to see what came next. 
Moe came up with the wrench, was met by the petty officer again and saw me with a knife. I was prepared to defend myself and I think at “That point” he backed down; knowing someone could die at any moment. 
I actually beat him in the fight considering he had the advantage by sucker punching me first and also having the other three guys throwing punches at me as well. 
I held my own and this meant that he knew he would have his hands full if he wanted to continue bullying me, knowing I would fight back. Having little to no sleep from the night before, I was very much in shock. I stayed in the dining room area that night and slept on the couch with that same knife by my side. 
The next morning the Boatswain’s mate inspected the deck below and what I didn’t know was the Petty Officer who aided in breaking up the fight had cleaned up after the fight and left it fairly clean. He too was a black guy and to this day am glad he stood up to that bitch Moe.  
As roll call happened on the fantail of the Sauk and the raising of the colors happened as usual, the Boatswain’s mate noticed the swelling on my face and asked me in front of the crew what happened to me. I replied to him in a shaky voice, “Nothing Boats!”  
I did not want to rat, so I kept my mouth shut as he continued to stare at my swollen face and must have known I was in a beef the night before. He didn’t push it and kind of smirked at me and walked away. 
Moe that prick, stood there glaring at me giving me daggers, trying to intimidate me from not ratting on him. I did not intend to do it anyways; I hate rats, so he never had to worry. 
Later that day the Boatswain’s mate, had Moe and I try moving a boat capstan from its stanchion with Moe trying to do it himself. He couldn’t do it, so I tried and just lifted that thing right out like Boat’s had asked. 
I glared at Moe and he and two others went below, the Boatswain’s mate left with them, as I was to pass this stanchion down to them. 
There was a point where Moe was starting to climb right below me as I held the 100 lb. hatch door open for him. I thought to myself, “Damn, I can just slam this hatch on his head and claim it was just an accident.” 
However, I thought to myself, “Murdering this prick would be nice, but if I got caught seeing how the night before I was in a fight with him, I would end up doing 10 years to life at Leavenworth.” 
It wasn’t worth it I thought. Nevertheless, for a couple of seconds, I really contemplated doing the whole thing. Slamming the hatch on his head, definitely cracking his skull open, then hear him crash down to the deck below in a big shit heap.
My days on the Sauk to this point became very nerve wracking and filled with high amounts of anxiety filled drama. Later that week, Moe was drying his clothes in the dryer in the bathroom and went down below to wait for his clothes to finish drying. 
I was still fucking pissed and what I did next to some would be considered crazy, since I slept literally 10 ft. from him. I grabbed his drying clothes, walked outside and threw the whole load right over the rail, into New York Harbor watching them within minutes sink alongside our boat in 12 ft. of gross NY harbor water. 
I left the boat immediately after and went to the bowling alley for some dinner and a beer, knowing I would be into it later that night with him again. 
9:30 that night came quickly and I returned to the boat. I went down into the birthing area and jumped up into my wrack, a wrack that was positioned topside so I had what I thought might be a tactical advantage. This idea was thought of on the first day I entered the birthing area. I must have had a premonition of the future battles down there. 
As I pulled down my sheets to sleep, I noticed the fucker had dumped a dustpan full of birthing room floor dirt, made up of a combination of dirt, pubes and boggers that had undoubtedly been dumped there by Moe. 
After I changed my sheets, I tried staying awake that night but eventually fell asleep, awaiting the arrival of my now new arch enemy, Moe Brazzel. 
Around three o’clock it happened. That asshole snatched me right out of my wrack and we began to battle immediately again, this time without the other three goons to level the playing field for him. 
We fought briefly for a minute before the Second-Class Engineer broke it up. Moe then said something I would never forget. He said, “I promise you; we are going to get you fucker. We are going to fuck with you every day,” he said!
One night on liberty from my duty station back in New York, I headed back to Massachusetts to my home in the city, back in Roslindale, a part of Boston. 
I just bought my first car, a brown Ford Gran Torino from my second-class engineer and it had a 350 Cleveland small block engine. It was a great first car for me and it drove great. 
When I got home, I headed out to see my other friends down in Rossie square. I would sometimes see these guys instead of my best buddies, a group of four guys, who I regularly hung with, but the reason I hung down the square away from my best buds, was because I would have a better chance of meeting some of the girls who hung in Rossie square.
 	The Rossie square guys were a mix of guys who were between 16- and 20-year-olds, and they often asked me to make beer runs to the local package store to buy alcohol and cases of beer for them. 
I regularly did this when I was 18, which was the legal drinking age in Mass for a while back around 1978. Eventually, due to increased problems with young OUI offences, they re-raised the drinking age back to 21. 
Since I was now 19 and they had been selling to me a year already, I kind of was grandfathered in as a legal alcohol buyer. Therefore, I made runs and bought cases of beer often, sometimes the hard stuff too, like Jack, Whiskey, Vodka and Tequila. 
Later that night after my run, we ended up hanging under the bridge at the Rossie tracks drinking and smoking weed. After a while as I was getting pretty drunk, I scooped one of the local chicks there that night, one of the girls who I had just bought alcohol for. 
All of a sudden, this car pulled into the adjacent parking lot and four guys got out and just invited themselves to hang with us since they knew some of the girls I was now with. Steven DeAngelo a 6’-2” Italian kid from Roslindale, a guy who had a fight with my buddy Ogg two weeks earlier, started chirping bullshit to me how he had beat up Ogg two weeks before. 
We continued arguing back and forth when I finally just told him to shut his mouth. I mentioned Ogg definitely kicked his ass and if DeAngelo who was pinned on the ground with Ogg hammering him didn’t squeeze Ogg’s balls like a little fag, Ogg would have given him more of a beating. 
Somewhat funny, I would have paid to have scene that one. I didn’t like Steven because he was known to have a big mouth and thought he was a tough guy. 
Steven got mad all of a sudden, came up to me and ripped my arm of this chick’s shoulder that I was kind of macking on just minutes earlier. He was jealous number one, because he liked her and saw me as a threat to his little chick pack that he thought in his own little weird mind he still controlled. 
He got in my face and began poking my chest with his right index finger, when he made the mistake of poking my right eye with his finger. 
I went totally nuts and attacked him, driving him back over against a 3’ elevated embankment railed wall. I grabbed him by both ears and pulled him right to my face and said, “You mother fucker,” and bit his face and began shaking him violently like a rabbit pit bull and with his right cheek in my teeth, I screamed, “Mother fucker, I’m going to fucking kill you!” 
I remember Chrissy O’Hearn told me, if I wanted to put fear into someone’s heart, bite their nose off like a mad dog. So that’s about what I did.
His friend, Jackie Bryant; out of nowhere, who saw me attaching DeAngelo viciously biting his face, swung a Bud bottle over my forehead; which at this point, didn’t even faze me. Steven at this same exact moment simultaneously pulled my jersey over my head, as you see in an NHL hockey fight and landed a few punches of his own. 
I recovered quickly by moving backwards and pulled the sweatshirt completely off and returned hammering his now bleeding face with shocking accuracy. 
It was now a melee with me fighting all four dudes and I actually held my own, when two things happened. One; Rat, a kid who grew up on my side of the tracks came to my defense, with two others with him and I, who began kicking their asses and two; the Popo who had just showed up, grabbed me around the neck all of a sudden and put me in a headlock. 
Rat just launched right onto the cops back, knocking him down, driving him to the ground, which gave me a chance to get the hell out of there. I was quick on my feet and escaped from the police unscathed, except my forehead, which now began swelling from the Bud bottle Jackie Bryant hit me with. I ran at least a half-mile feeling a strange burning in my feet. 
Apparently since I was wearing boots that I never usually wore; they were causing me a little pain since both heels on my souls had fallen off during the fight and I was now running flatfooted until I got home. 
When I got home, Ogg, John and my brother Timmy were in my living room getting high. I came in and began screaming at them, “Get up, and let’s go, I want to go kill these mother fuckers!” They being stoned and now kind of in shock said, “What the hell happened?”  
	I went into a five-minute dialog of the brawl I was just in. My sister Kate at that point came home from her shift as a nurse at the Brockton VA still dressed in her white nursing uniform. As she came in, she saw the bump on my head when I realized something was wrong with my feet. 
Still wearing my boots now without heels, I sat down and asked her to pull the boots off my feet. As she removed my right boot, the blood that had built up from the wounds from the nails that use to be holding my heels on, now were embedded into my feet. 
As she pulled off the first boot, she got blood all over her white uniform and said, “What the fuck!” Then she pulled the other boot off and it was bleeding as well. 
Both my sister and brother tried to convince me to calm down and not go off after DeAngelo and his crew. After hearing about the brawl, Ogg was pretty happy to hear that I beat up DeAngelo and bit his face. He said, “Yule you’re fucking crazy!” They talked me into getting high and to remain at my home and I eventually calmed down.
This was not just an average night of liberty at home in Boston away from the living nightmare I had back on the boat. 
I was often anxious, had a frame of mind of being irritable and angry and would often fight at the drop of a hat. Next night I left for New York picking Todd up at home where I left him 3 days earlier. Now we were off back to New York where I had to continue my horrible life back in New York. 
Living aboard the Sauk with all the black guys determined to persistently mess with me was pretty tough. What’s kind of ironic about this whole thing is that I had always considered myself to be a very liberal!  
A background further strengthened by my parents’ strong convictions which included their own involvement in the black community with mom working as a welfare agent and dad working with inner city youths as the assistant athletic director helping the poorest in our city. 
Hanging with friends in Boston every chance I got always was interesting. One weekend Me Jimmy and John Hearn went clubbing but I remember John somehow forgot his ID so he stayed in the car.
Jim O’Connor and I went into the club and began drinking. Jimmy began eyeing one of the bouncer’s girlfriends and apparently, she liked Jimmy too as before long Jimmy scooped this chick and began making out with her.
All of a sudden, this jealous bouncer sees this and try’s sucker punching Jimmy and I remember just blocking the punch right before it landed. 
All hell breaks out and Jim and I end up being rushed out the door fighting like 5 bouncers’ but little did we know a little while before there were other guys still mulling around outside who got tossed earlier too. 
They took advantage of this chance and wanted revenge so they jumped the bouncers, at the door. I was fighting one guy when all of a sudden out of nowhere, I got lifted by the seat of my pants and thrown over the railing and landed on the hood of a car right below.
Jimmy fought this one bouncer to a draw but they forced him out too! And we just left counting our blessing we weren’t hurt at all! 
It’s late, I gotta be in New York in six hours and I missed my train, so Jimmy offers to drive me to New York. 
Funny part of this is they fell asleep and when they awoke, we were on the Deegan expressway on a bridge where all of a sudden 6 lanes converged to three and I was unaware that this was going to happen and just as they woke up, we merged and they screamed as we almost got side swiped by taxis on either side of us, funny as fuck! 
The boys got on Governor’s Island and saw the nightmare of a boat I was on, as I thanked them and said my goodbyes and they were off!
There were other times where my life became threatened by insane acts, but for the grace of God I survived!
When I’d leave the boat, I’d head to Boston for a long weekend and party with friends at home. Usually heading home on a Sunday night, I’d take the Amtrak from Boston to Grand Central Station in New York and arrive around 2 in the morning.
So, as I arrived at Grand Central this one night, I transferred trains to take the train to South Ferry. It was late July and I was about to turn 20. Nervously I began to hear guys screaming and raising hell and watched them jump the turnstile where I was waiting for my train.
Oh my god, they saw me and said let’s fuck this white boy up! One had a baseball bat, the other had a thick chain and I was like 150 feet away from them.
As they got closer to me, they started yelling and screaming and I remember how the guy with the bat kept banging the bat on the ground, while the guy with the chain, swung it against the walls.
At that moment, I remembered when I was a kid, how Frank O’Brien and I walked the elevated train tracks down at Dudley station at 2 o’clock in the morning after trains stopped running.
I got my inspiration and said fuck it and just jumped into the track tunnel and began running my ass off to the next train station.
The worst of it was they did too. Hollering and screaming at me, as I imagined I’d be shot and left to rot in this god forsaken shithole. 
I could hear my heart beating so loudly in my ears as the buzz I had previously was now totally gone. I ran and ran until I reached the next station and climbed up some stairs and just thought I’d exit the train system and get a cab, which I did above around 36th street.  What a night! 

As I began shaking his hand, he quickly jerked my arm and hand between my legs. Apparently, this was a judo move he knew all too well, then grabbed my hand, now in-between my legs, then pulled up hard, using his two hands which made me do a flip, where I landed on my back. 
Now totally confused I started thinking, “What a dick,” right? You suck asshole I thought to myself! But he way I started bootcamp doing one-hand pushups and being an idiot and doing the opposite of keeping a low profile, perhaps I deserved some of these parting shots!


Chapter 8: Ice-Breaking up the Hudson River
 
Ice breaking up the Hudson River during the winter was fun since we took turns with our fleet back at Governor’s Island going north up the Hudson River. Halfway between New York City and Albany was a gorgeous little town called Poughkeepsie, New York. 
It accommodated a famous Coastie-biker bar named Mike’s bar where bikers often battled with Coasties. In this bar there were life rings hanging from the walls, from all the Coast Guard cutters who had patrolled the river or had ice-breaking duties as ours did. 
My 110’ tug, the Sauk, had a ring up on the wall as well and my chief had me sign it for posterity’s sake. In this pub there were a couple of pool tables where I would often play for drinks, in which I never lost! 
I was a shark growing up at home with a pool table from an early age. This pub also strangely had oil lanterns at every table which furnished most of the light in the pub at night. 
I thought this was kind of a strange and almost a dangerous combination in a pub that featured many fights between locals and us. 
One night we had arrived at Mike’s and there were several chiefs from my boat including my chief, Senior Chief Harris, nicknamed shaky from the obvious tremors he had from his heavy drinking bouts. 
In addition, with us was the chief boatswain’s mate, Chief Hawk, a six foot two, strong, lean man who came along with us that night. Not much of a partier but got along with the other Coast Guard crews who were also there. 
I remember sitting at the bar drinking pints of cold draft beer when I ran out of money. Just 19 years old, drunk, I decided to help myself to the tap when the overwhelmed bar tender turned his back to me. 
I quickly reached over the bar to fill my glass as fast as I could. The second time I did this I noticed I was being watched by this black Army dude who was wearing his uniform, he being the only black dude among over 100 white people made him really stand out. 
As I started my second stolen pour, he said quietly to me, “Hey you don’t have to do that; I’ll buy you a beer, what kind you want?” Like a wiseass I said to him, “I’ll have a Heineken, thanks.” He bought me a Heineken on the next beer. 
At first, I thought to myself, what is this dude doing here, especially since I myself was having such a hard time with my own black crew. 
After he bought my beer, I decided to myself that this person might actually be a decent guy and I befriended him, since he was by himself in a sea of white bikers. 
We started talking and sharing stories back and forth, when I noticed six large bikers who wear wearing leathers, started getting loud focusing on my new friend, the only black dude in the bar. 
What happened next was totally unscripted, but having just befriended this person, I realized it was not going down very well with these bikers whatsoever. This one really big bastard, like 6’-3”, weighing in at least 280 pounds, walked right up to my new army buddy, grabbed the dude’s beer right out of his hand, and proceeded to spit in it. 
Looking right in the eyes of this now very nervous soldier and saying loudly, “We don’t like niggers up here in this bar!”  
At this point I was now faced the opposite direction sitting backwards in this bar stool, a position which gave me a bird’s eye view of this guy and his friends behind him. The army guy knew he was in a lot of trouble and I felt really bad for him.  
There is something about me which I know I inherited from both parents, especially dad, which makes me always to want to pull for the under-dog. This guy who out of nowhere, offered to buy me a beer because he instinctively knew I might actually be a good guy, was now totally classified in my book as a total under-dog.   
I at that moment took it upon myself to try to help this dude. Just being in the same position on my boat where I was recently sucker punched and jumped by guys that in my opinion were no better than these white trash biker assholes. 
I felt a strong sense of injustice and knew I wasn’t going to walk away from this man who I knew was going to get jumped as I had been just weeks earlier.   
I looked at this biker and spoke in a loud clear voice, with most of my beer buzz now totally gone, and said to him, “Why don’t you leave this guy alone, he isn’t bothering anybody, why don’t you just fuck-off?” 
Huh, well I’ll be damned! The biker looked me right in the eyes and said to me, “Ok, you want to be this nigger’s friend huh? Get up and fight me then you nigger lover!”  
He was close enough to me where he could have just drilled me in the head with a right hook, which would have left me in a screwed position. However, he didn’t and he proceeded to back up and he then said very loudly, “I’ll give you 3 seconds to get off that bar stool and fight me.” 
In my head I started counting, One Mississippi, fuck it one split second later I thought, I slid off the bar stool, dropping my pint on the floor while grabbing my stool in my right hand and swung this 75-pound weapon as hard as I could.   
	Bam, I landed this stool right on top of this fucker’s noggin landing him on the floor right in front of me. Without hesitation I booted this guy in the ribs with my steel toed boots on and must have kicked him three or four more times when all of a sudden, his friend who I did not know was next to me, suckered me in the temple knocking me to the floor. 
At least six drunk, pissed off bikers wailed on me as I was overwhelmed on the bottom of the pile.
Well out of nowhere my Senior Chief Hawk grabbed me up and lifted me right out of the pile, while simultaneously all of the Coast Guard guys and bikers were now all in a huge riot. Chairs, bottles, fist and boots wear flying everywhere. I was still myself fighting these same bikers, when I got a chance to move closer to the door, where I was then joined by my Senior Chief Harris.  
He just hit some dude of the head with a Bud bottle and said, “Let’s go Cronin, wait, watch this,” he said. He grabbed an oil lantern off a table and hurled it right across the bar room and I witnessed it explode in flames on a wall next to the pool tables. 
Holy shit the place was in total mayhem. Over fifty people were now brawling; the place was now on fire and my chief grabbed me and laughingly said, “Let’s get the fuck out of here!”   
We began running through an icy field, toward a hill that led to our boat dock. It had an inch of fresh snow covering up the ice which rested below it from an ice storm the night before. 
My chief kept falling down, so I grabbed him up and threw him over my shoulder since he was kind of a smaller guy and we continued sprinting toward the boat. 
As we arrived at the docks, we noticed two things right away. A bunch of townie-bikers were in full pursuit of our escape to the boat and two; our boat had engines running with our other boatswain’s mate standing on the boat next to the pier with an M-16 in his hands.   
The scene was frantic! The bar in the distance was on fire, we were now under siege by the rebel bikers and now it looked like these people who were now approaching us, were going to overrun our boat. The boatswains mate fired a volley into the air and screamed, “I will shoot at anyone trying to board this vessel!”
This had no effect in the pursuing mob and all of the crew gathered ready to brawl with the bikers, when the skipper who saw about 15 townie bikers running down the dock toward us, decided to take matters into his own hands. 
He threw the tug in full reverse dragging the dock off its moorings and kept pulling the now sinking dock all the way out into the icy river as at least 10 bikers were now all floating amongst the thick ice chunks and swimming through the black icy waters of the Hudson River screaming profanities as they headed back to the dry shore.
We sat there maybe 350 yards off shore watching for over an hour as the chaos was beginning to wind down. The fire department arrived shortly after we pulled the town dock into the Hudson. 
They were finishing putting out the blaze in the bar which my Chief had caused as we remained floating in the dark waters of the Hudson almost until morning. 
During the following day as we headed back down river to New York Harbor, I got ordered to clean the skipper’s stateroom and because I again had little sleep, still a little drunk and definitely hung over, I fell asleep while vacuuming the skipper’s rugs.  
Boats and the skipper who all knew how the brawl started by now had come into the stateroom and began watching me as I laid there snoring next to a running vacuum cleaner. They watched me sleep for a minute and woke me up by lightly kicking my ribs. 
The skipper began questioning me what happened the night before with kind of a wry smile on his face. He asked, “Cronin, what kind of shit did you start last night that almost cost us to shoot some townies?” 
I told the skipper what happened and all he said was, “Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess!” He left me to finish cleaning with a laugh shared between him and boats.
We returned to Mikes two weeks later and by then they had repaired the drywall, the curtains and the water damage caused by the fire departments dousing of the fire. Boats made up a rumor that the person I booted who started the whole brawl, had broken ribs and that he was going to shoot me if I returned to the pub. I did not really believe him though, although I was sure I did probably break a few of that asshole’s ribs. 
Weeks later all of the Chiefs and petty officers who were all older white men in our fleet, some big dudes too hung with me at Mike’s. I do not know if they thought there would be more trouble, but I do remember them drinking and hanging with me in the poolroom area of the pub.  
I stuck with playing pool and felt a little safer with a pool cue in my hand. One of the other petty officers decided to bet me money on a pool game. 
He put up a $20 spot and I whipped his ass quickly, running the last four balls, and then sinking the 8-ball on a bank shot. 
He went double or nothing but had similar results minutes later. He now being down by forty dollars came up with a plan to recoup his money.  
He bet me again, double or nothing, that I couldn’t down a pitcher of beer in one pull. I saw this as an opportunity to make another $40 bucks, making it an even $80, so I took the bet.   
I stood at the pool table with a cold pitcher of beer in my hands next to the now $80 bucks on the pool table. I took a couple of deep breaths and began slugging down all of the beer. 
Getting close to finishing I noticed looking through the bottom of the glass pitcher that Flip the petty officer I was in the bet with, had been holding his breath and turning reddish, blueish color which through the bottom of the pitcher reminded me of a blowfish. 
He stuck his face right at the bottom of the now almost empty pitcher and I took my focus off the task and kind of laughed as I was just a few gulps from making the $80 clear.   
Well, I laughed, chocked, coughed and spit up the nearly gallon of beer I just consumed back into the pitcher. Flip screamed victoriously and about four other dudes with side bets on this feat were all screaming too. Damn I came so close! 
Eventually the incident of me standing up for the black army dude at the bar spread to the black crewmembers. They heard how I stood up for him and ended up battling those biker assholes, putting my ass on the line for that soldier.  
This bought me a little favor among the brothers and it somewhat gave them a reason to lighten up on me for a while. It was short lived though, as I now remained the only white enlisted guy in the birthing area with them again the next spring, Oh fuck! 
On the Sauk one day, I reported as the mess cook to the new cook, who was a black cook from Harlem. I remember assisting this guy and watching him prepare meals for the crew. 
I witnessed him several times doing things like spitting in our captain’s food. Our captain was a southerner with a pension for pulling liberty anytime things went wrong.  
The cook one day looked me right in the eyes and said to me, “I put soap powder in anybody’s food that I don’t like.” He explained what happens to people who get a dose of household cleanser in their food. 
He said, “They eat this food and within hours they’ll begin throwing up and having diarrhea.” Well, I must have pissed him off somehow because the very next day after eating chow, I began puking over the side of the boat, simultaneously having mean diarrhea. He got me the bastard! He seemed joyful to see me so sick. 
I asked him if he messed with my food and he never answered me, just smiled, shrugged his shoulders and walked away. 
From that day on I cooked my own meals or ate off the boat. As if I needed more stress, but this was just the latest bullshit I had to deal with. 
So as if things could not get any worse, I remember having breakfast and two hours later I remember looking in the mirror to find myself on an LSD trip. 
One of my crewmembers and I suspect the cook again, had slipped some LSD into my food or drink. I was on duty that day but began tripping and being onboard was the last place I wanted to be, so I decided to just get up and leave the boat.  
I remember walking through Manhattan tripping and ending up finding Central Park. I kind of just hung out there for the day and eventually found myself in a bar, pounding beers, and the yeast in the bear somehow made me come down off of the LSD long enough to make me realize I was going to be screwed when I returned back onboard. 
I ended up written up the next day, getting busted down to E-1 again. Life was sucking! The cook; six months later, was removed from our boat for date raping some white Coastie chick! 
He ended up in Leavenworth I think for something like five years. Karma can be a cold bitch, don’t you think?!? 
The New York tugboat strike happened next while I was stationed on the Sauk. During a citywide strike by tugboat operators and dockworkers in New York City that began on 1 April 1979, Mayor Ed Koch of New York asked for federal assistance. 
The Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams, at the behest of President Jimmy Carter, ordered the Commandant ADM John B. Hayes, to direct the commanding officer of the Third Coast Guard District VADM Robert I. Price, "To cooperate with Mayor Koch in the movement of sanitation barges within the harbor."  
Beginning on 7 May 1979, the Sauk, along with the cutters Mahoney, Manitou and Red Beech began moving 16 garbage scows from a Staten Island landfill on the Toms-Kiehls River site to trash pick-up points from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. 
Although the group received an anonymous bomb threat that proved to be a hoax, the movement of garbage happened without incident into the month of June and other Coast Guard Cutter such as the Snohomish relieved the cutters in June. 
One night I was ordered to stand watch on the fleet of tugboats and our boat with a loaded shotgun by my side. A bunch of dockworkers jumped the fence to probably vandalize the tugs but I chased them off right away. 
Two hours later I was off duty and I remember going to a bar across from the tugboat yard. Bad move! When I was there four dockworkers noticed me on the phone chatting with my parents back in Boston and said they were going to kick my ass as I was talking with my mother back at home in Boston. 
I told her, “Mom these guys are outside waiting to kick my ass, “Holy fuck,” I said. I eventually hung up leaving her in a state of terror for me for what turned out to over 48 hours.
But what really happened was that I waited an hour or so more after I hung up the phone from her and drank a couple of beers. 
As time went on, I saw a back door and I snuck out it, jumped a wall, walked down a driveway, climbed one more fence and now some hundred-sixty feet down the street away from the bar at this point, I just walked back to the boat unseen on the road.  
Having put the thoughts about the incident right out of my mind and not remembering I scared the shit out of my mom with my impending ass kicking, I forgot to call her to let her know I was fine. 
Two days later as I was up on the bridge, assisting the piloting of the tug boat, actually listening to the Quarter Master’s directions as to how much to turn the wheel, we got a strange live radio message from Coast Guard Headquarters in New York, asking if I was safe onboard the Cutter Sauk.  
The skipper replied that I was and the New York radio dispatcher said to the skipper that his parents were frantically calling all over to see if I was all right. At that moment, I remembered my conversation with my parents and just sheepishly smiled, thinking what a dope I was!
I remember one morning in July when we hooked up to one of the barges and began heading down the Hudson River towards the dump on the Toms-Kiehls River landfill site bordering New York and New Jersey States, when all of a sudden, the barge began filling up with water quickly. 
Apparently, one of the striking dockworkers snuck onto the barge, just seconds before we arrived, opened up a hatch which led to the barge filling up with dirty river water as we began towing it to New Jersey.  
As we began listing heavily to the right under the weight of the sinking barge that was full of garbage, we jumped on board the garbage barge looking for the hatch but were unable to locate it in time. 
Next, we began dewatering the barge with our p-250 submersible pumps, as a frantic race went on to keep the barge afloat long enough for us to find the hidden hatch or ground it in shallow water.  
The battle was lost and my chief decided to untie the sinking barge. Our towlines however were now fastened to tight to the barge under the intense pressure and begun to list our 110’ boat heavily to the right. 
	The chief tried releasing the boat coxswain to no avail, so he yelled at us to clear out, grabbed the deck ax and with three swings, cut our 4” towlines as they recoiled like an angry elastically pressured steel coil, which once cut swung back toward the coxswain slamming it hard, causing it to partially crack it. 
If someone got in the way you can be sure someone may have gotten pretty hurt.  
During the same time of the strike, our Captain decided to refurbish our galley. Therefore, we lived on this tug without our galley and now had maggots from the garbage barges getting onto the boat. 
Life was miserable at this point and forced to work seven days a week for two months in a row without any breaks was nerve-wracking. No hot food and a crew most of which were all the E-1’s-E-3’s who were all minorities except me. 
A few white Petty Officers and Chiefs also rounded off the crew, who could leave the boat at night, but not us. We lived in very miserable conditions to say the least.
About a year had gone by and I was still on the boat as Icebreaking was finished and the strike was now over and we had a few other interesting calls in the interim. 
Most of the white guys that were placed temporarily on the tug, during icebreaking season, came and left the tugboat, but not me, my school was taken away from me because of the AWOL article seven court martial right-up.   
The situation at this point would take another turn for the worse and later that spring one morning on a Saturday, I went up to our crew’s bathroom to brush my teeth and shower. 
As I got into the head, I decided I needed a shave. I went below to our berthing area for my razor and shaving cream, came back up the latter, went into the head and began brushing my teeth before I shaved. 
The three assholes who I got jumped by were in the dining hall, when all of a sudden Moe came into the bathroom and began laughing at me as I was now in my underwear brushing my teeth. 
I asked him what was so funny. He looked at me and said, “Look at your toothbrush.” I did so immediately and then noticed that my toothbrush was dirty. He laughed in my face hysterically and told me he scrubbed the toilet with my toothbrush.  
Next thing I knew, I muttered, “Fuck you,” as he got right in my face again. Well, this time, I decided in a split second I was going to make him pay. 
I quickly grabbed him by the back of the head and slammed it into the steel bulkhead, making a huge, huge thud, and watched him stumble backwards four feet and the shit hit the fan again. 
He rushed at me this time with the other two backing him up and since I was just about to shower, still in my underwear, they tackled me to the deck and began booting me all over with their steel toed boots on.   
This lasted a couple of minutes, but I managed to escape down the latter to the birthing area. Moe was above screaming he was going to kill me as I grabbed my clothes, moved forward into the bow of the ship, quickly got dressed, took my wallet and escaped through a hatch on the bow. I could hear Moe scream, “where the fuck did he go?” 
As I escaped, I knew I could not do this shit anymore. I went through the bow hatch and jumped off the boat onto the dock and escaped undetected. I knew I never wanted to live on this tug ever again. I made my way to the ferry, landed back on Manhattan and decided I was not going back.  
I took a bus ride back up to Boston and eventually made my way up to Maine with Nancy some woman I was dating. I guess what happened next was Ellie Lashua; my parents’ friend, had somehow tipped my father I was up in Naples. 
He unbeknownst to me, drove all the way up there, came into the trailer and caught me in his bed with Nance.  
He asked me why I was not in New York and I told him I was on leave. However, the Coast Guard which was now looking to locate me, had phoned my dad in Boston and told him I was AWOL.  
We immediately left Maine and we began driving towards Boston. On the way I told him most of everything that had gone on as he listened intently. We first dropped Nance back in Roslindale and headed back toward New York on a long four-hour dreaded ride. 
We ate first and later he actually drove me from the ferry and escorted me back all the way to the boat. I got back onboard and was immediately greeted by the Chief Boatswains mate. 
The captain’s mast happened next and I told them some of what happened but still got busted down in grade to E-1 again.  
Now as punishment I was restricted to the boat for the duration of the two-week trip up country to Albany where we would be leaving for momentarily. To add insult to injury, all the black dudes’ liberty was pulled too, as we were now getting underway for our journey up the Hudson River. 
I left the captains quarters and headed back to my rack and met immediately by Moe and three other black dudes. He told me that the Skipper just cancelled all shore leave for all of them for the entire two-week trip because of hearing some of what happened to me the prior week.  
Moe approached me, grabbed me by my shirt collar, with his buds nearby and said, “We are going to fucking kill you on this trip, you are not going to make it back alive!” I pushed him away and climbed topside to contemplate my next move.  
Most everyone was up now on the fantail getting ready to begin our journey when I decided to make my move and jump off the tug as it began reversing into the Hudson. 
This move could not have been made a second later when I jumped on the dock, as I just made it to the pylon almost falling backward off the dock into the green harbor water, but instead catching my balance and strolled down the now empty concrete dock.
The skipper immediately stopped the boat, got outside the bridge and started yelling at me, “Cronin get your ass back on board this second.” I ignored him and made my way toward the end of the dock with the intention of going AWOL again. 
Little did I know my dad who had dropped me off an hour earlier had waited at the end of the pier. He had some kind of intuition that I needed him, Thank God!  
I will remember what happened next until the day I die! My dad approached me on the dock, grabbed me, looked me in the eyes, saw how distraught I was and yelled up to my skipper without any hesitation that I was going to now report to sickbay on the island. 
First the skipper challenged my dad by saying like hell he is, get him back onboard this second. Dad never liked anyone ordering him to do anything, never mind when it involved the safety of his favorite child.   
My dad replied, “No, he is having a nervous breakdown, he has the right to see a Doctor, I am bringing him to the base psychiatrist to be seen immediately!” 
The skipper at this moment gave up and continued reversing the Sauk out of its slip to begin its two-week journey, without me ever having to set foot on board ever again. Phew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Now dad and I were heading to the base hospital with me telling him everything that had just gone down. My dad just listened assuring me he would see me through it. 
Going to the hospital with dad being irate was something, he had first asked and then demanded that the base chief psychiatrist see me.  
A Coast Guard Captain with a lot of influence saw me 15 minutes later. I re-counted everything that had gone on the previous two years and must have spoken to him with my dad by my side for over an hour. He was shocked at the horrors that I survived through and decided officially right then and there to remove me off the boat for good. 


Chapter 9: Island Life
 
My dad had saved my ass once again! The Sauk was gone for two weeks; I in the meantime was to temporarily be stationed at the hospital barracks and within days got reassigned on the Island Special Services department with a bunch of other mostly white guys, some of whom I became friends with. 
My worst nightmare was officially over, but unfortunately for me, there was still more to come from Governor’s Island, considered the worst duty station in the Coast Guard! Some of it caused me to have lingering lifelong affects that would stay with me most of my life!  
Life off the Cutter Sauk improved things tremendously at first and being stationed in the unit on the island called Special Services gave me a wide array of fun odd tasks and jobs to do. DC Chief Rhonahan at Castle Williams, an older white guy from the Bronx was directly in charge of me. 
In our immediate unit, we had a bunch of guys who were basically E-1s, E-2s and E-3s that were placed with Rhonahan, but also a couple of Petty Officers mixed in too. 
Most of us were given one last chance to turn things around before being forced out of the Coast Guard as an undesirable, some of us performed and some did not!
Our unit was in charge of all of the sports and entertainment for all of the officers and enlisted people on the island. Responsibilities included setting up for special events and parties that the command wanted us to do, three island gyms, a golf course, four ball fields, two football fields, the movie theatre, the bowling alley, the swimming pool and maintaining all of them would be our job.  
I landed a job cutting and marking ball fields at first since I had prior experience doing this earlier in life, working with my dad at White Stadium. Some notable things happened next, which became a big part of my life, influencing my future in a profoundly negative way for years into the future.
The barracks I was assigned into landed me with a guy who was from Long Island named Dave. His job included setting up for island parties when they warranted it. His other position, while not involved in island party affairs, was working in the bowling alley too. Dave quickly showed me the ropes on island barracks living and how-to party in our room without getting caught. 
	I actually became friends with an E-1 named Apollo Piñati who was a derelict. Apollo was an adopted kid from Italy who was adopted by a family in Dover Mass. who was originally was from Italy too. Stationed on the island at special services with me, we spent the better part of a year hanging out as friends; until however, Apollo eventually would have a huge negative impact on my life! 
Even still at the same time was Peter Todd my best friend still stationed on the Tamaroa who would split driving back home to Boston to save on gas with me. One weekend I went home with Peter who brought a few guys with him for rides home throughout New England as well. 
I dropped most of them off at the bus stop in Boston, where they would then take bus rides north to New Hampshire. Later that weekend I picked Peter up again to begin our trip back to New York, when Peter assured me, he had money for tolls since I just filled the tank up with gas. 
Peter asked me if we could stop at a package store to pick up some beer, so I readily agreed. We now continued our drive in my Gran Torino with our first stop at the Massachusetts Turnpike west toll both. As we approached, I asked him for toll money and he just sat there with a wry smile on his face, holding a cold Bud in his hand. 
Now two cars in line in front of us, I repeated my request, when he blurted out he had just spent the rest of his money on the case of beer he bought ten minutes before. Now realizing we had no money between us and second in line, I decided to drive through the toll as the guy in front of me went through. 
The toll both gate went up to let him through and I quickly hit the gas and drove through without paying. The arm came down on the top of the windshield, bouncing back up which allowed us to escape the toll. 
I screamed at Peter and said, “I thought you said you had toll money.” He replied, “I did but I bought the beer with it.” “God you’re a dick,” I said. We had to sneak through a couple of more tolls; one where we just pulled up and immediately drove right through, making our escape into the night.
Hanging with Peter was wild! I remember one-night drinking on the south side of Governors Island. We sat on a long 12’ long picnic table with the Tamaroa crew on one side and another rival boat crew on the other. 
I sat on the Tamaroa side watching Peter argue with the other crew about the football league they were both in, with an impending game happening the next day. Peter began picking a fight with the other crew; true to form, Peter announced they would settle their argument right then and there.
So, imagine a bunch of dudes sitting on a long picnic table, one side with five Tamaroa guys, with me and the other with six guys from their neighboring ship. 
All of a sudden Peter sitting beside me screamed, “Now,” jumped up, pulled me off the table and the rest of the Tam crew all jumped off the long picnic table at the same time, causing the table to flip completely over on top of the other crew because of the huge weight imbalance. 
Peter and crew simultaneously jumped on top of the table which then pinned the other crew down and they began slapping and punching the rival crew. I just stood there laughing my ass off, as the now stunned crew got onto their feet now retreating as Peter kicked one guy in the ass laughing hysterically at him. 
I would often invite Peter to hang out with him and so I invited him to my Godfathers bar in Manhattan called Barrymore’s. We often drank there free and got buzzed and would sometimes either eat or end up in more mischief. 
One night we went to a live sex show on 42 street, kind of like the combat zone we had back in Boston. A young cute hooker in the club approached Peter and I and asked us if we wanted a massage. 
I followed her into the back room where I got a message, but it led her asking him if I wanted to have sex, so without hesitation I said yes. 
The problem now was I laid there naked without any more money. The girl asked him if I had anybody there to lend me another $80, so I sent her out to ask Peter for some. 
She brought me back with her into the room as Peter then laughed at me lying naked under a sheet as he threw $80 on the table and laughed aloud said, “Cronin you’re fucking too much!” 
Later meeting Peter outside with a smile still on my face, he greeted me drunk as shit, while he suddenly punched me in the stomach, with me falling to the ground, still laughing and gasping for air. 
I knew Peter since boot camp and I knew we were very close buds and would continue our adventures together for at least another year to come on the island.
Hanging with Peter and the Tamaroa dudes was always fun. One night down at Greenwich Village drinking and listening to a live band perform, we had racked up a $200 tab and Peter; always the perpetual ringleader, had preplanned our escape out of the bar without paying out tab. 
He had two Tamaroa guys start fighting each other on the other side of the bar, causing the bouncers to all converge on them, thus allowing the rest of us to slide out the front door.  
Not knowing his diversionary tactics and dismayed at the prospect of now ripping off this poor attractive waitress, who had busted her ass all night long for us, I decided not to leave and she approached me worried she was getting stiffed. 
I coughed up $240 to give it to her, watching her smile with a relieved look in her eyes, she hugged me good night and thanked me. 
Getting outside I was pissed and approached Peter and yelled, “What the fuck dude, that sucked, why did you want to stiff that fucking girl?” He screamed at me that I was fucking idiot and very stupid. I told him to fuck off when one of his crew mates, a 6’-2” 250-pound Mainer also got in my face. 
He shoved me like four feet backwards and said he was going to kick my ass. He came at me and I just remember repeatedly hammering his face with right roundhouse punches driving him backwards. 
The fight ended up pretty even with the top of my head bleeding badly. I left the group and headed back to the island on my own, getting back to my barracks where I fell asleep still drunk, waking up the next day finding my pillow completely soaked with blood.
Friday night fish fights were another source of entertainment back at our barracks. We would often drink and smoke weed and bet on different species of fish that once put into the same tank would often battle each other to death. Piranhas were always usually the winner, with an occasional exception to the rule. 
One night four of us decided to drop some LSD and partake in the Friday night ritual. What we didn’t know was that the next-door neighbor knew of our plans in advance to trip and watch the fish fight. He elaborately pre-cut a hole in the drop ceiling panel in the room where the fight was. 
At some point, he climbed up the wall from the adjoining room, leaned over onto our ceiling and hung his head upside down, with his head protruding down from the ceiling.  
Honest to God you should have been there! The fish fight that night was particularly vicious, with this Chinese fighting fish beating and killing the Parana. Tripping and now peaking, I repositioned my seat on the couch, now accidently tilting my head on the couch looking up toward the corner of the room, now really tripping balls.  
All of a sudden, I noticed a head hanging from the ceiling, staring right at me, eyes not blinking whatsoever. 
First thinking to myself, boy I didn’t just actually see that, did I? I looked back again a second time, seeing it once again; I figured it was just a fake head glued up there to mess with us. 
Still staring at it and it still staring at me, the damn eyes all of a sudden blinked and I jumped up and screamed, “Oh fuck, it’s alive!” 
All of us still tripping dudes stared in shock at the head and ran out of the room together, all five guys tripping balls, running and screaming the whole while. 
We continued to run into the parking lot with all of us still screaming and laughing uncontrollably still in shock, but still laughing our asses off! 
On a journey to Boston this time with Apollo with me. We decided to take the train down to the Boston Commons. True to form, Apollo brought some LSD with him and we dropped a hit as we began our journey. 
We ventured downtown riding the Orange line and hanging out on the Commons for a while. Later we ended up at Forest Hills Station; waiting to take a bus back to Roslindale, when a police paddy wagon rolled up to us still in the station and the cop rolled down his window and knowing my father and I from the Stadium, offered us a ride inside the locked paddy wagon. 
Tripping now, we drove in the back of the wagon, with Apollo asking me, “Sure you know these cops, are we going to jail?” I laughed and thought it was cool, riding in the back of a paddy wagon, knowing we were just getting a ride home with him freaking out. 
The next night at home still with Apollo with me, I got ahold of my dad’s car. We bought a case of beer, had an ounce of good weed, and Apollo and I dropped another hit of windowpane. 
Driving the first hour was okay. Having smoked a little while also drinking a couple of beers, we ended up an hour later, now fully tripping balls, downtown. 
Somewhere near Harvard Square we turned off onto a road that put us into the town just west of Boston. I realized that if I just turned around and headed back over the road where I took the wrong turn, we could be back into Cambridge, where I then knew how to get back to Boston from there. 
Looking back the direction I needed to go in was a four-lane street heading the exact opposite way we needed to go in. I thought; rather irrationally, that if I just drove on the sidewalk for what looked like 100 yards or so, I could get back onto the correct road. 
We started across this short connector street heading the wrong way now on the sidewalk. Then I realized the wide sidewalk we were on, had been dug up and that the parking meters which were now waiting to be re-installed, sat there incased inside a concrete ball which would be eventually placed back into a hole and buried with another layer of poured concrete over it. 
I decided it might be a good idea to grab a parking meter and take it with us as a souvenir, Apollo all too willing agreed. We got the parking meter back into my dad’s station wagon and continued to drive on the sidewalk heading the opposite direction of the four lanes. 
We had the remains of a case of beer on the floor of the front seat, an open ounce of weed on the dashboard, also with a parking meter in the back seat, us now tripping heavily, when all of a sudden, the police pulled next to us, blue lights flashing and with us just sitting there obviously very busted.
The cop approached us cautiously from the side of the car and walked up to me with a flashlight now beaming right into my very stoned eyes, and said, “Holy shit what are you guys doing?” He looked at me without waiting for a response and immediately asked me for my license and registration.  
I replied quickly as I handed him my military ID, and said, “Please officer, I know this looks bad, but please don’t arrest us, my ship is leaving from New York tomorrow and if you arrest us, we’ll never make it back and we will be considered AWOL.”
He began looking around inside the car saw not only the case of beer on the floor, but the ounce of weed sitting on the dash as well. Still searching our vehicle, he now focused on the back seat, where he couldn’t believe what he saw, the parking meter in the back seat. 
He screamed, “What the fuck is this?” At that moment as I sat there grinning, I tried begging the officer to have mercy on us, saying “Okay, I know I’m busted but please give a military guy a break!” 
He mumbled “Oh my God,” and went on to say in a rather pissed off voice, “Get that fucking parking meter out of the back seat right now and put it back on the sidewalk.” 
I quickly obliged, immediately lifting it back and putting it down quickly back onto the sidewalk and got back into the driver’s seat and explained to him, if he could just show us the way back to Boston, I promised him I would go home and sleep it off. 
Unexpectedly he said for me to follow him, making us drive off the sidewalk and turning the car around following him in the right direction of the four lanes. He then made a right followed by a left, which put us back into familiar territory back into Cambridge. 
We followed him to the BU Bridge and as he turned right, I decided I would turn down a familiar road where we then ended up parting ways from this very cool cop. 
By rights, he should have arrested both of us for being so intoxicated, with me getting an OUI as well. Just another case of me getting away with murder again and avoiding what would have surely led to an OUI and possibly the loss of my license. 
I made it home with Piñati and we later on went to sleep. Before we went to sleep; however, Apollo briefly met my sister where he blurted aloud that he’d love to fuck her. I got pissed off, grabbed him quickly and told him to shut his mouth or I’d kick his ass. He pushed me back and we almost came to blows. 
The next day I thought he forgot it and we took the train together back to New York leaving South Station. We separated and I didn’t see him until a couple of weeks later, when he invited me to a going away party of this guy, who actually didn’t like me very much at all. I went anyways against better judgement, such a bad decision! 
It was a typical Saturday night and the party I got invited to was in the lower bar at the enlisted man’s club, since we were all part of special services, we had free use of the bar and booze. Apollo was bartending and pouring me beer after beer. I pounded down like 6 pints of beer and had a wicked buzz on. 
I thought to myself that I felt so much drunker than I usually did with that much alcohol in my system. The party was for the guy who didn’t really like me and who got orders to leave the next day off island.  
All of a sudden, everything seemed to be happening in slow motion when the guy who the party was for came up to me as I sat there at the bar and he began telling me I was a fucking asshole, which I responded back to him for him to go fuck himself. 
He went to grab me and I remember putting up my right hand, now feeling very intoxicated, he grabbed my thumb, bending it back, then still holding my bent thumb back, suckered punched me off the bar stool. I fell to the floor and immediately flew into a rage. 
I attached him tackling him to the floor and began pounding his head with right hooks. Five dudes, who were his friends, including Piñati, began kicking and punching me as I still continued punching this asshole. 
About two minutes into the fight word must have spread to the bar above where Peter my buddy was drinking with the Tamaroa guys. 
Peter flew into our bar with six others and we all started brawling Apollo and his friends. I again tackled the bastard who started the brawl and continued fighting with him. 
All of a sudden, I felt something from behind me, beginning to choke me out. At that moment, my right hand got cuffed and my left arm was now thrown behind my back. 
I dove forward; breaking the hold the now big MP had on me, now armed with a makeshift pair of brass knuckles on my right hand, I swung at the MP, knocking him down. 
Moments later I now was at the receiving end of a hail of Billy clubs getting the shit knocked out of me. I eventually got tackled by three of them and now was properly cuffed tightly with my arms behind me.  
Four of them carried me out into an awaiting squad car, heaving me upside down in the backseat of the car. I continued in a rage, smashing the back window out of the car with my legs, kicking as hard as I could. 
After all, four of the MPs grabbed me and threw me into the makeshift jail cell, which was a floor to ceiling fence with a makeshift pad lock now tightly locked.  
I furiously and now highly intoxicated began running toward the locked door, jumping up in the air, landing with all of my force, trying to knock down the door with both feet, still handcuffed behind my back. 
The fourth attempt actually broke the hinges of the locked gate and my next run was right into the four awaiting MPs who then grabbed me up in mid-stride, picked me up, slammed me upside down into a fifty-gallon drum where I got knocked out apparently and after that I don’t remember anything else until the next day.
The next morning came abruptly for me as I was woken up by revelry now being played for the whole base, with special accommodations for me via loudspeaker inside the detention cell. I awoke with my head pounding, hands cuffed behind me still, tied to the metal rack, barely able to see out of my swollen eyes.  
The six MPs who were now getting off duty, all mustered up, staring down at me, as I laid there helplessly at their mercy. This big goddamn MP came forward, stared at me and said, “Remember me asshole?” He uneasily gave me a slight smirk, which revealed that he was now missing his two top teeth. 
Also in that moment, I saw blood all over his shirt collar and chin. Apparently during the initial attempt to get cuffs on me, I had knocked his teeth out using the cuffs as brass knuckles as he attempted to put them on me.
They were required to try to sober me up. The alcohol had worn off; however, but I now realized I was still tripping. The MPs brought me in a metal tray with a meal that was nicknamed, “SOS,” which was short for “Shit on a shingle.” Some type of beef gravy mixture crap over toast. 
I attempted to eat it, but could not get it down, throwing it up into a well-placed garbage can beside me. Realizing I was still highly intoxicated, but somewhat kind of in control of myself, they decided to call my Chief, Chief Rhonahan who came over to check me out. 
He said they needed to have me checked out at the base hospital. Black and blue from head to toe and very much drugged out of my skull, they brought me over to the infirmary, patched me up and gave me a drug test, where they eventually told me I showed high levels of having LSD and Quaaludes in my blood system. 
Medical orders came down from the on-call Doctor that stipulated I needed to go into a detox immediately. The detox I was going to was off Island, over on Staten Island. So still in handcuffs, I boarded a jeep with Chief Rhonahan and sat in the front seat. 
Feeling everything all at once from being concussed, tripping, and still feeling nauseous from the morning breakfast, I told Rhonahan I felt sick. The Coast Guard ferry, now underway heading back toward Battery Park in lower Manhattan, was now chugging through the choppy harbor waters rocking up and down. 
I again reminded Rhonahan that I felt sick and he asked me if I could make it to Manhattan on the other side and I told him no way. 
It was a miserable gloomy Sunday morning, unusually windy, steaming toward Manhattan, when I said, “Rhonahan, I’m going to throw up.” He said, “Can you at least puke over the rail of the boat?” I said, “Probably.” 
He escorted me to the rail, but I noticed the rail was too tall for me to puke over since the rail was like four and a half feet high. I did not attempt to throw up by putting my face over the rail, especially since the wind would have blown the puke back into my face. 
I decided to jump up and land on my stomach on the nearly foot wide flat railing, still cuffed behind my back. I must have jumped too hard because I found myself now dangling over the CG ferry, puking viciously into New York Harbor, with Rhonahan holding me by the ankles. 
Turning my head back in-between puking bouts, I noticed a little girl, dressed up in her pretty white Sunday dress, accompanied by the base commander and his wife, heading to St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan, witnessing this Hooligan being held around his ankles, very gracelessly vomiting over the side of the boat with his chief holding him by the ankles.  
At that moment it hit me, I was a fucking mess! The spectacle lasted a few minutes more, with Rhonahan still holding me, while I precariously perched myself on top of the ferry railing, for the entire world to see, vomiting over and over. 
Eventually the mother shielded her daughter, covering her eyes and relocating her to the bow of the boat way away from that horrible scene. 
The Ferry landed and we drove right by the Commander, his wife and the now staring, startled little girl, who looked at me with a forlorn and shocked look, thinking God only knows what.
After another ride on a ferry, the Staten Island Ferry, we pulled away from the slip now heading towards Staten Island. 
Watching Manhattan disappear into the distance. We then drove a short while once we landed on Staten Island, entered into the hospital where I was examined quickly and sent to the eighth floor to the detox unit. 
Met by another Doctor in the unit, I was then escorted into my room, where I stood at the threshold of the door waiting further instructions by the nurse. 
I then stared into a picture of a sailing boat in a harbor, when this oil painting right in front of me turned into the face of the devil, melted and oozed down the damn wall. 
I said, “Holy fuck!” The nurse asked me what was up and after I told her my vision, she quickly conferred with the Doctor who came back and shot me up with something that retired my ass to a hospital bed for what would be a two-day sleep. 
A day and a half later, I awoke still tripping seeing trails of movement that one typically sees on LSD. I stayed in that condition for close to 10 more days, having an extended stay in the detox until the heavy trails had subsided. 
While I was in detox, I received doses of that drug that helped me the first initial days to detoxify without having any huge amounts of delirium tremors. 
My parents found out somehow, drove down to New York and visited me in the detox. Seeing me bruised from head to toe and hearing how it happened, I think they decided it was time to get me off that island once and for all.  
After that happened, I entered a 30-day alcohol drug rehab unit and released on a condition that I go to AA meetings afterward. I was obviously tabbed by Apollo and I tried when I got back confronting him, but I was never was able to track him down. 
Either he would be out of his barracks or not there at the special services unit where I searched for him. I knew that fucker tabbed me and now I thought I was in a ton of trouble.   
What happened next, I pieced together some years later. Dad in his infinite wisdom had used some heavy-duty connections which got me placed into Damage Control School on the island.
I agreed to a combination of AA meetings while under the control of a Damage Control Instructor at DC school who was a sober alcoholic. 
I somehow got to attend DC school and found out eventually that it was because of my dad’s influential connections with Tip O’Neil’s son. 
I guess Tip O’Neil himself from his son’s request had pulled strings and got me placed into Damage Control School, which in retrospect, I am so thankful for! 
This would now make it possible for me to forego any kind of punishment that I otherwise might have faced. This school was still on Governors Island, but if I succeeded here, I would now get a path to a promotion to Petty Officer and finally get new orders stationed off the Island.
DC school was tough, especially after just coming out of detox the month before. I fought off having a nervous breakdown as well, while befriended by my new sponsor and DC Chief. 
Unofficially, he sponsored me and I just barely made it out of the boot camp like atmosphere at the DC school. 
Somehow during our conversation that night he mentioned he collected antique trains and I said to him we had them growing up as kids. I told him I would talk with my dad to see if he would part with a set of our Lionel trains, which he agreed to and delivered the day I graduated from DC school. 


   Chapter 10: Boston You’re My Home
 	Orders came up the day of graduation and I was stationed back home in the North End of Boston, on Causeway Street. Assigned to a team that welded and repaired boats in Boston Harbor was so cool. 
I even lived off base at home which gave me more money by getting BAQ compensation. Dad never admitted as much, but the strings he pulled with Tip O’Neil Jr to get me into DC school and finally getting me off Governors Island probably included sending me to Boston too. 
A mixture of great things and not so great things happened to me next. One huge advantage I had was having my dad and I hang out together and go to many Red Sox, Celtic and even Bruin games. 
Timmy went to more Bruins games than I, but I never complained since dad preferred to take me to all of the Red Sox and Celtics games getting us great free tickets from Havlovac and Coughlin Sporting Goods Company, a company who dad hired to supply most of the Boston Schools sporting goods.  
Dad and I saw many sporting events together including many playoff Celtic’s games watching Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parrish, Danny Ainge and DJ, win three titles. 
We watched many games where we defeated the Lakers at home. We eventually watched Michael Jordan one night lose to the Celtics in triple overtime, where Jordan set a league record in a playoff game scoring 63 points singlehandedly. 
The Celtics prevailed in that game and I remember seeing it with my dad. That year we went on and won it all. Dad and I grew even closer and reflecting back on it without him, I may have died down in New York. 
As a DC 3rd Class Petty Officer, I actually did pretty well. I showed up every day on time, worked hard and even welded with the team next door quite often. I passed every requirement necessary and passed my test, which should have allowed me to be promoted to 2nd Class Petty Officer.  
However, my Chief, a southerner from Nashville Tennessee did not like me because I was a Boston Irish kid and did not put me up for promotion. I tried going over his head but since he was just promoted to Master Chief himself, he now had too much clout to mess with.  
What made matters worse is he promoted another kid who came into the shop after me, who had less seniority than I had. Fucking southerners hate northern boys, especially Bostonians like me, that’s just the way it is and always has been.  
I got assignments taking me south to Cape Cod for boat repairs and for the first time in a while, I felt great. I started a regimen which included attending AA meetings while on some medications which leveled me off enough to work and started dating this girl Maryanne who I just met. 
I was on the wrong medications however which did not address my schizophrenic symptoms all that great however.  
Dating would soon pose a problem on its own that I had never dealt with before and that was having a normal trusting relationship. 
Newly sober and still in my opinion feeling the effects of my New York three-year extended stay, which ended with being tabbed with a lot of LSD, I quickly found out I was not in any condition to successfully date. 
Up in Boston working on the maintenance team, (378 MAT Team), we did maintenance for many of the ships that called Boston their homeport. The Chase and the Hamilton were two 378’ ships that docked in Boston too, where we worked with a bunch of other Damage Controlman who were stationed on these ships. 
One ship had a DC second-class petty officer named Joe Carlson. Joe was a man who got into the Coast Guard after a stint in the Army. Joe; wasn’t wired to tight, got himself killed the night before his ship was to go on patrol in Florida for a three-month departure during the Cuban boat crisis. 
Joe had some shipmates at his house with him the night before they were to leave and they drank very heavily. Joe’s wife was out working a shift as a nurse in a hospital, which left Joe home alone with his drinking buddies.  
Joe drank himself into a blackout that night and reportedly thought he heard dudes yelling and screaming in the woods behind his house. Joe thought that taking out a 357 magnum and firing some warning shots into the night air and into the woods behind his house was a good idea. 
Repeating this over a fifteen-minute period of time, a neighbor called the Boston Police and a squad car arrived at the bottom of Joe’s driveway.
They saw Joe with his 357 still clutched in his hand and the cop’s both drew out their weapons. When both cops yelled at Joe, demanding he drop his weapon, Joe turned in the direction of the two cops holding the gun now in the officers’ direction.  
They now feeling threatened both fired a couple of rounds at Joe and both hitting him in the chest, dropping him on the spot. After CPR failed in the ambulance ride, they pronounced him DOA as they arrived at the hospital. 
A couple of weeks later at Joe’s funeral and subsequent burial which was at St. Joseph’s cemetery on one of the coldest days of the year in West Roxbury, I witnessed just how much Joe’s three young kids and his beautiful wife were now completely devastated. They now faced a life without a father and husband and were all very, very heartbroken! 
Later that week while driving with Maryanne in my car, she asked me to swing by her house to get money in her room. She left my car and ran upstairs, while I waited for her outside in the car. I decided to look for a stick of gum in her pocketbook, which I found, but saw a prescription package of birth-control pills in her pocketbook as well.  
I examined the script to see if I could tell if the script was a current one. For some reason, the script did not have a date on it, which would have solved the issue as to whether or not she was currently on birth control or not at that time.  
Schizophrenia by now had taken root in my still young confused mind, which led me often to have paranoid ideations, which often accompanied suspicions of suspected infidelity that I continually imagined since I was in this relationship. I grilled Maryanne intensely and I actually doubted she was telling me the truth.
My thoughts at that moment were if she was on birth control and I was using condoms, why would she need birth control pills, was she having sex with others behind my back? 
I actually became obsessed at the idea that she was screwing around on me and somehow, I had to figure out how to get to the truth and I would eventually go to extraordinary lengths to do so!
A few months later when I was welding something in the DC shop on the Hamilton, I had auditory hallucinations as I stared at a tile knife resting on the welding bench next to me. 
I hallucinated hearing Joe’s voice very clearly telling me to take the knife with me and go to the Bill Beard clinic downtown and take Maryanne’s file from the filling cabinet.
Back in 1981 records of course were kept in filing cabinets in manila folders and not stored on a computer hard drive as they are now. 
So, I got in my car at lunchtime, left the base and drove to the clinic driving down the infamous four-lane Jamaica way Drive at very erratic speeds. 
Many people had died in horrible car wrecks the previous 50 years or so on this road and me driving like a crazy person showed just how out of it I really was. 
I arrived near the Bill Beard Clinic in the South End in Boston and without hesitation, left the vehicle and ascended upstairs into the clinic. I quickly surveyed the office and found a group of cabinets where I suspected patient files were kept.
As I approached the cabinets, I pulled my knife from my pocket and wielded it in a threatening way as I began opening cabinet drawers in search of Maryanne’s file.  
This one crazy nurse employed at the clinic raced over to me, so I swung the tile knife in the air in front of her face to persuade her to back off. 
Out of the corner of my eye as I scanned the files, I saw her ready to lunge at me again if I attempted to grab a file. After locating her file, I grabbed the file right behind hers and pulled it from the cabinet drawer.
Predicting her move correctly which was her retrieving the file from my hands, she did exactly that, which allowed me to then grab MaryAnn’s file and retreat with it. 
Now with the correct file in hand, I began my escape from the clinic. As I ran down the stairs, I realized once again that this big nurse was still on my tail. 
I bolted down the stairs but strangely enough was hit by an eight-foot-long 2x4 stud in the back of the head. Where she got a hold of a wooden stud to this day I’ll never know! 
I was in such a manic state of mind during the whole event that I didn’t even think to look over my shoulder after I left the clinic and headed directly back to my car. 
Apparently this one brave nurse followed me back to the car, wrote down my license plate, called the police, and detailed the events to them.  
The nurse bravely attempted to intervene at my successful attempt to steal the file. In her mind, she may have thought I could have been one of her patient’s boyfriends attempting to garner evidence of Maryann’s now aborted baby whom she now feared I may act revengefully toward. 
She went above and beyond protecting her client and her calling the cops on me was a necessity that put me in the police’s crosshairs. 
I pulled over on the way home and read the file thoroughly, examining it for evidence as to whether or not she had an active birth-control prescription. I actually never saw any recent prescriptions on file to refill the drug, so I took the file out and trashed it in a garbage can on the sidewalk.  
I know what you are thinking, he is Insane right? To me that had to be the next logical step however! Getting the file was of the utmost importance to me! I had to discover the truth no matter what the cost! 
I however, did not actually find any evidence of her still being on birth control or at least from that clinic. 
Somehow the police must have called my father on top of calling me when I finally went home. Since the station in charge of the clinic was located in the South End, which was also that same precinct station 13 near White Stadium and where years earlier my dad had been brought to for beating up the archbishop and still had many friends working there. 
Because of this they did not come and immediately arrest me. Dad’s friends still at the precinct concluded I was not a threat anymore to anyone after questioning me on the phone, getting my story on why I stole the file in the first place. 
They made me promise two things, that I would not attempt to find Maryanne that night and for me to promise to show up downtown at court the next day with my father escorting me.  I agreed!
Going to court the next day with dad was strange! I potentially could now go to jail and be in trouble with the Coast Guard as well. The judge told me to explain the whole event, which I did, including the part of how I heard voices of my deceased friend telling me how to do this whole thing.  
The big nurse which had bravely interfered in my robbery attempt was there as well, representing the clinic’s interests that day. During the conversation in front of the judge, I painfully recalled the event and after doing so, I did assure the nurse I would not touch Maryanne.
After explaining the story and listening to the strange circumstances that now became known to the court, she contemplated withdrawing the charges after my father convinced the judge to forgo criminal charges in lieu of agreeing to send me into a hospital for an evaluation and treatment for at least a month.  
Given this forced treatment sentence the clinic actually did decide to drop the charges as long as I completed a month in a psychiatric unit. Dad now had to find me a psychiatric ward willing to take me in on short notice. 
We first tried the Faulkner Hospital near our house in Roslindale and they accepted me with open arms. After I discussed what took place before and after the clinic with the doctors listening intently, they diagnosed me as having some type of manic episode and started me on a treatment course of Lithium. 
The hospital was cozy enough and even had young women patients there my age to keep me company. About the third day in the ward, now under the influence of various drugs, I decided I would leave the hospital and walk home through the Arboretum which was right next to the Faulkner hospital. 
Sneaking out of the ward meant I had to leave it without my sneakers since they were locked up and I could not get them. 
I did manage to escape and begun my mile walk home fully dressed, but without shoes on, just socks. Of all people whom did I meet in the Arbs but Ogg!  He was up the arbs by himself getting high as usual, and when he saw me, he inquired as to what the fuck I was doing, especially since I was not wearing shoes or sneakers.  
Sitting there up the arbs all medicated out, smoking a joint with Ogg and telling him the whole story, including of me hearing hallucinations of my dead friend, the plan of the abortion clinic and I think he knew of my subsequent LSD tabbing in New York, he rightly convinced me to walk back to the hospital to continue treatment. 
I actually contemplated all the alternatives and concluded that I had to finish my mandatory sentence, or possible face going to jail. 
Leaving Ogg at that point and going back into the hospital was my best course of action I thought. Ogg was convinced I was insane and he did tell me so as parting words as I began walking away, saying, “Yule you’re fucking nuts, go back to the nuthouse,” he said! 
Sneaking back inside the locked ward proved to be much harder than sneaking out! They found out I left the grounds and then busted me smoking weed since my breath smelt like pot. On top of that, the nurse practitioner said I now probably would be discharged, so I punched the wall beside her head. SMART RIGHT!
Bad Idea, I was placed in restraints for two hours as my dad was now summoned back to remove me from the hospital. Boy, was he pissed! 
Mom tagged along with us at this point and we had to find another facility that would take me. They finally agreed on trying the Brockton VA where they did agree to admit me. 
The doctors at the VA had a consult with me and agreed to admit me there too. My dad was still in with the psychiatrist while my mother and I were in the waiting area of the hospital. 
How this one patient got into the visitor’s room, I’ll never know. As we sat there, this one kook walked up to my mother, dropped his draws and began beating off right in my mother’s face. 
While he was beating his meat, he was saying aloud, “Oh boy Oh boy oh boy, Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy!”     I almost fainted but recovered and charged this loon shoving him violently against the wall as my mother franticly screamed for help. Drs. and orderlies in white coats all converged on us as I began wrestling and punching this weirdo.  
Mom now in a very agitated and distraught voice yelled, “Neil we are leaving this damn place immediately if not sooner, he’ll either kill someone or he’ll be killed himself!” 
“Oh fuck,” dad thought, “What to do now, what to do?” 
As they contemplated our next move in the car, dad eventually brought me up to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital over in Brighton. Getting another consult with the psychiatric staff doctors who after hearing the bizarre situation I put myself in, also agreed to take me in.  
I got in that day much to the relief of my parents and stayed at the hospital for over four weeks meeting the mandatory sentence from the judge. 
I agreed upon release conditionally, I would go into outpatient treatment over at the Brighton Marine Public Health Clinic, which was next to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital.  
The hospital month tried different types of drugs and settled on Navane–Cogentin and lithium. I felt helpless for the next 6 months. I felt homicidal, suicidal, paranoid, manic and attempted suicide during this time. 
Also, during this time, I was living at home with my parents, going to work in the Coast Guard, and my mother’s advice to me was maybe I should think about getting shock treatments. 
My response to her was how about a lobotomy too? What do you want me to be like Rose Kennedy and be fucked up for life? As it was, I was put on the wrong medications and that would be the case for another ten years or so. Shock treatments, really Ma?
This would start my introduction to therapy with a man named Jim Lavelle, a Social Worker with an MSW and another doctor named Dr. Mollica a Harvard PHD graduate based out of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. I received therapy counseling for many years there, which did help quite a bit.  
They eventually attributed toward me getting a 35% service-connected medical retirement from the Coast Guard, which in retrospect, was a great life-altering event. 
For years after I continued suffering from bouts of schizophrenia and or manic depression and underwent treatment with every known psychiatric medication on the market. I felt like a Guinea pig taking every known psychiatric drug on the market!
When the Coast Guard convened a medical board to evaluate Dr. Mollica’s diagnosis as such, the doctor then also identified the tabbing of LSD incident in New York as a possible reason for my psychiatric conditions or at least something that compounded the problem. 
This led the Coast Guard into agreeing that my injuries were service connected, a huge step in getting a medical retirement. 
After the medical board reached this conclusion, my father and I reported to the Coast Guard Headquarters on Causeway Street in Boston a month later. 
In this meeting there was a Coast Guard officer from administration and a Coast Guard appointed lawyer representing me where they offered me two options.  
The first was a tempting offer for a young man such as myself that offered me a onetime $23,000 check, that once accepted would immediately terminate my six-year Coast Guard stint without any further medical treatment accessibility and future disability retirement pay.  
The second offer was a 35% Coast Guard retirement which entitled me to retire from the Coast Guard with 35% of my monthly salary and any medical attention I would ever need in the future, also including giving anybody in my future, such as a wife or kids, Tri-care medical insurance too.  
Both the lawyer and my dad agreed that taking the money would be a big mistake. I first looked at it like; I would be able to go out and buy a new vehicle paying for it outright, or receive free medical for life both very tempting for me. 
However, my father and the lawyer both spoke right up and convinced me to take the 35% retirement and forego the $23,000 check and explained that if I ever got sick again from my symptoms, I would have no medical privileges to fall back on.  
Dad also told me I could also join the VA and use their facilities as well. The lawyer piped up explaining the real possibility of getting a higher compensation rating eventually, which may pay up to 3 million dollars in benefits over the course of a lifetime. 
The lawyer continued and explained I may possibly get insurance coverage and possible college tuition assistance for future family members if that were eventually to be in the cards.  
Taking the retirement and forgoing the cash payout was a no-brainer! I took it and did continue to receive medical treatments which I get even today. The road I took was a road filled with many psychotherapy sessions and another three stints in psych hospitals some decades ago.  
I took everything in the way of psychiatric medications, from Thorazine, to Lithium-Tegretol combinations for treating a misdiagnosed bi-polar disorder which in reality I have been now correctly diagnosed as having schizoid-affective with paranoid schizophrenic symptoms. 
Maryann my girlfriend who I actually got engaged to, did actually have an affair with a man named Mike Vojack. As one day after work, I called Maryann up and she told me she was not up for hanging out with me that she just wanted to stay home and rest.   
A paranoid vision came into my head that she was going to sneak out of her house and leave with someone. I lied to her and told her on the phone that I was okay with her staying in and that I did not mind. 
I today look at it like I have telepathy. Many times, I did hear thoughts that were projected to me that I envisioned accurately that I can no longer call a coincidence. 
So, I right away drove my car over to her and as I rounded the corner, I saw her getting into this dude’s car, just exactly what I had envisioned she would be doing. 
A little in shock, even though I kind of predicted this, I jumped out of my car and approached this man who had rolled down his window and told Maryann to get in his car. He said for me to mind my business, so I bitch slapped his face and yanked him out of the car window. 
When he stood up, I realized this dude was 6’-4”, but at that moment, I circled him counterclockwise getting the high side of the hill with the sun now in his eyes, giving me height on the upper part of the hill. We began to fight for a second, but then he ran off into a neighbor’s yard pulling out his EMT badge yelling, “Call the police, call the police.” I shook my head as Maryann ran back into her house and went home.
Almost a year later, after a long break-up with her, I began dating Maryann again and eventually gave her a beautiful 1-karat diamond engagement ring. 
My sister said it was basically my fault she cheated on me since all of my suspicions had taken a toll on her psyche. However, knowing finally that she fucked this dude after she finally admitted it to me, never ever sat to well with me!
So, one night in Roslindale at home with Maryann and my parents, my mom asked me to get milk and a couple of groceries at the supermarket over in the next town over in West Roxbury. 
I left with Maryann in my black Ford Broncho and headed over to the store. I went in as Maryann sat there waiting for me. On the side of the building, in plain view of the front of the store. 
When I bent over to get the milk on the bottom shelf I stood up and bumped into someone’s chest as they were reaching for cream on an upper shelf. 
Because I bumped into someone’s chest, I immediately looked to see who it was and realized it was Mike who just laughed in my face, so I instantly put down my groceries on the floor right in front of him and just left the store without saying or buying anything. 
I got back into the Broncho and said to Maryann, “I’m going to fucking kill him; I’m going to kill this mother fucker!” She now being very perplexed asked me what and who the hell I was talking about and I just told her “You’ll see, just wait, you’ll see!” 
Mike came out about five minutes later with a brown back of groceries and I jumped out of my Broncho and screamed, “Hey maggot I am going to kick your ass!” He put down his groceries and took his glasses off and said, “Do it then mother fucker,” egging me on. 
I quickly walked up to him and threw a cross block up into his neck driving him back up onto a car. At that time, I had been taking Shaolin Karate and was being taught by an eighth-degree black belt who was a phenomenal fighter and a master in martial arts. 
As he slid back off the roof I kneed him in the nuts, grabbed his hair and slammed his head into a parked car, denting the vehicle badly on the driver’s door. 
I immediately began throwing right roundhouse hooks into his head on his temple and under his jaw. I hit him over 30 times quickly and very hard, as the fire department dudes from across the street ran over, and four firefighters grabbed my arms and legs, lifting me off Mike, exposing my groin to him.   
He jumped up taking advantage of the four firefighters lifting me off the ground and punched me in the nuts as the firefighters had me hoisted in the air. One of them seeing the unfair position they had put me in, said, “Fuck it, let him go!”  
I tackled Mike a second later but he somehow grabbed both thumbs on each hand and put me into a thumb lock bending my thumbs back all of the way to my wrist. To this day I have bad arthritis in my left thumb because of this. 
Now in pain, without the use of my hands and arms, as his hands and arms were also tied up locking down my thumbs, I bit his face and told him if he did not let go, I was going to bite off his nose. Not convinced, he continued with the thumb locks. 
I bit down on him a little harder enough on his face to draw blood which convinced him I was not fooling around, as I yelled, “Let go of my thumbs mother fucker or I’ll bite off your nose!” 
He let go that second, which freed up my hands and I wailed his temple and jaw again for another 40 shots. 
The fire dudes pulled me off again and I scrambled back on my feet and retreated to my truck parked 15’ away.  
Before I got in, I went to the only license plate behind the truck and bent the corners of the plate inward so he could not read it in the event he tried getting my number.  
Maryann witnessed the whole thing and was now slumped down low into the front passenger seat, so Mike didn’t see her in the truck. 
Some older woman gave Mike a pen and paper and he ran up close to my truck as I began my escape out of the parking lot. 
His face was pouring blood from his nose, above his eyes, swollen jaw and temples. To add insult to injury, as Mike ran up to write down my plate number, I hawked a loogy and hit him right between the eyes. 
The spit and blood dripped down his face as I stepped on the gas now darting out onto a busy Center St. full of traffic in West Roxbury, as he continued running beside the truck positioning himself to write down the number. 
As I pulled into traffic and when he finally got behind the truck, he realized I bent my license plate so he could not write down my plate number.  
Driving away, I said to Maryann, “I told you I was going to get him!” She just said “WTF”, and said, ”You are an asshole!” However, that did not bother me, as the dude that fucked my girlfriend just got a beat-down from me. 
After driving her back to her house, I went out, found Ogg and partied with him for a couple of hours up the arbs, telling him of my battle. “Nothing much ever changes with you Yule,” he said, “You are fucking crazy dude!”  
A little before this stage in my life around the same time the Maryann saga was still going on I began taking martial arts at Fred Villari’s home studio in Dedham Massachusetts. 
He reigned over the most karate studios in the world and was recognized in the World Book of Guinness as having the most studios in the world as well and had the fasted punch per second record in the world. I got trained well! 
Villari studios got a bad reputation as the McDonalds of karate, with so many studios and many people getting black belts, most of the community thought somehow, it wasn’t legit.  
People questioned how good the training actually was. However, I was under the tutelage of Jimmy Bryant, an eighth-degree black belt who was Villari’s top instructor. Master Villari also gave us lessons there since this was his home branch. 
Jimmy was a fun instructor as he had a relaxed class, never making us treat him as his master status usually required. The things he taught us were definitely great fighting techniques since it was Shaolin Karate, a mix of kung-Fu and Jujitsu. 
A devastating combination of fighting techniques I loved learning about, that took a great street fighter as myself and made me even more dangerous. 
He used to joke while he watched me make up my own Kenpo karate moves and nicknamed me, Rossie-Fu!” 
Maryann and I were supposed to get married in early spring. I had saved up money now working in the carpenters Union and Christmas was coming up. 
However, I had been invited to a wedding with my cousin and at the wedding I ended up screwing one of my cousins’ girlfriends. I then realized getting married wasn’t a good idea so my manic mind decided to get up and leave for LA for 2 weeks and blow the wedding money I had put aside. 
Oh, Christ did I party with strange woman and had fun. I came back Christmas Eve and dad asked me if it was worth it. I said yes and I remember him saying at least did you get Maryann anything for Christmas. I hadn’t. He was pissed! I broke it off with her 2 days after not seeing her that Christmas.


Chapter 11: Union Days
 
In 1983 my dad got me into the Carpenter’s Union as an apprentice. The local I joined was Local 67, the Irish local located in Dorchester, Massachusetts. 
The territory for this local was from the South End, in Boston, to towns like South Boston, West Roxbury, Roslindale, Jamaicaplane, Hyde Park and parts of Dorchester, all still within the official Boston jurisdiction. 
I entered the union trained in metal fabrication, welding and some carpentry. Working as an apprentice at first meant being the low man on the totem pole still having to take orders from journeyman. 
The one advantage I had was learning how to weld metal studs, something of a trick since the metal was so thin. I used a 6013-welding rod since it was a low penetration high deposit steel rod, which would not melt the thin 16–18-gauge metal studs.  
Welding studs was a specialty that few knew how to do but had its dangers since the galvanize coating on the studs was zinc oxide, that once melted gave off an acidic smoke that was hazardous to breath. Or put it this way, once in vapor form it was turned into acid and if breathed in would melt your lungs!  
On one of my jobs at Boston University dormitories we had special clips to weld to studs that attached an exterior stone fascia, a lightweight fabricated stone veneer that mocked stone siding which required expensive staging all the way up the side of the building.  
As the job went into full swing, they hired another welder who tried to replace me by telling the supervisor we would not have to use staging to weld these clips, potentially saving a lot of money. 
The staging at that point was only up to the first floor, with ten more floors that needed staging to finish the stone veneer installation. Not having to set up staging would save thousands of dollars from the budget and make the head supervisor look really good.
The trouble with welding clips on the studs when you hung over the edge of the building, reaching over to weld while placing yourself above and over the smoke from the welding process, placed you in great danger of getting galvanize or zinc oxide poisoning.  
I watched this journeyman weld and saw he was getting too much smoke into his mask and told the foreman he was going to get very sick and that I needed the staging set up as usual. 
That afternoon I was laid-off at about 2:30 in the afternoon. Just shaking my head, I just said whatever to myself, packed up my tools and left.  
About a week later I received a call from the supervisor who asked me to come back to his crew. I asked why and he told me that the other welder ended up in the hospital in critical condition and had permanently messed his lungs up as a result of the horrible practice he used to replace me with. 
Do to inhaling zinc oxide vapors, which just vaporized and turned into a smoky acid plume, he had not only ruined his lungs, but scarred his face horribly too. 
The supervisor assured me from now on we would use the staging and that I would be in charge from that point on. I took the job, which lasted another nine months or so more.   
Downtown Boston had total Union control and hired strictly Union workers from all trades on big projects. My local’s jurisdiction was in the outlying parts of Boston which butted heads with a bunch of non-union companies that often resulted in conflict. 
Most of the jobs the unions were interested in were government procured jobs that paid well to any company winning the competitive bids. 
Many times, the non-union contractors got onto the bidding list and could always undercut union companies since they paid low wages without any healthcare benefits. 
The scab contractors; as we referred to them as, would not pay their workers any health care benefits and did pay a paltry hourly wage and therefor pocketed the extra money as profit. 
Once a union placed a picket line up all union workers would usually never cross the line. Negotiations would sometimes come after the job shut down due to not enough trained workers getting union companies back on the job site. 
One time over in West Roxbury there was a government bid job and a nonunion company from New Hampshire had won the bid. They hired a bunch of out of state workers and paid them garbage wages around $12 an hour. 
The profits from this type of job must have been staggering for the owners and they must have made a mint. 
On this same job in West Roxbury, we placed a picket line up on this scab company and the supervisor hassled us constantly yelling at the picketers. He was from out of state too, which just pissed us off even more. 
One day as I volunteered on the picket line, this supervisor got into his truck and purposely backed into one of our picketers, an older guy who had tenure in our local.
He hurt his leg and back, but the scab super just drove away as if nothing happened. The supervisor just denied the whole incident, so Tommy Mansell the president of our local called me and told me to join the picket line. 
He was mad as hell and told me to mess with this supervisor any way I could. I did do things right away like having their portable potties removed from the job on a Saturday when they were off for the weekend. 
Tommy came back around that Monday and told me our guy got really hurt. I then took it to a whole other level on my own and really messed hard with this guy and concocted a really sinister plan for revenge.  
I watched the next week and saw concrete trucks arrive at the property and I took note to who they were. At that moment I came up with an idea. The next week I called this concrete company an ordered 25 yards of concrete to be delivered to the site. 25 yards amounts to about five truckloads and they came pretty much all at once.   
As I sat there in my Oldsmobile 442 listening to music, my picket-line partner lit up a joint and began smoking it. 
I was sober at the time and did not share in any smoking, but probably got a contact buzz anyways. It was a sunny day when two of the trucks showed up at the job and drove onto the construction lot.  
The supervisor had been eating lunch with the crew but came out of his trailer to see why there were now two concrete trucks in their driveway. 
When the two drivers began arguing back and forth with the supervisor, it got very interesting and I sat there watching the whole thing unfold.   
During this time, I noticed truck three got stuck under the Temple Street Bridge in West Roxbury, way down at the beginning of the street. 
The bridge was arched and the truck got stuck on its right side where the arch was lower on that side. The driver had to let out some of the air on his right truck tires, but quickly continued to the site now angry as hell.  
When he finally got there, he heard the supervisor now repeat the claim he had not ordered any of the concrete and had no intention of paying for it. 
I watched the supervisor get pushed as he continued to scream at the drivers that his company usually always did the ordering from the office and that it wasn’t his company that did it and they were in no way going to pay for the 25 yards of fresh concrete. 
At that moment the now seething third driver sucker punched the supervisor and a big fight broke out between the drivers and now stunned supervisor aided by two other carpenters in a three-on-three melee.  
At this exact moment we watched all of this unfold from my car, while still with Gary Devall my union friend still getting high in my 442. Tommy my president snuck up to my car and startled me by banging on my window, knocking as if he were pissed off. 
He actually was pissed off at us when I rolled down the window and the smoke poured out the car, hitting him right in the face. He said, “Christopher, what the fuck are you two doing, why aren’t you two manning the line, and what the hell are you two smoking?”  
I told him nervously we were on brake, but that I had ordered some extra concrete for the scabs free of charge. Still going on at that moment, the drivers were now in a full-on fight with the supervisor and the crew and the supervisor had just got knocked on his ass.   
Tommy immediately forgot about the fact that my car was full of smoke and he said, “Oh my god you ordered them concrete, how much?” After telling him I ordered 25 yards, the other two trucks arrived on the job making it five trucks in all and chaos continued to ensue! 
He began laughing hysterically and said in his Irish brogue, “Oh my god this is great, you fucking did well Christopher!” He ran back into his car, drove to the corner, parked and took pictures of all the trucks just standing there on the lot, while the drivers were all still beefing and screaming at each other.
I got the nickname of concrete Cronin for a while and actually got in good with Tommy landing quite a few great union jobs after that that lasted for years after that incident. 
During the union days the economy slowed down and getting work became harder. I solicited many of my own jobs however because of my specialty in welding and framing metal studs. 
I remember telling the President Tommy that I knocked up my girlfriend and he said what are you going to do about it. I said I was going to get married, so he got me work immediately.  
He caught me lying so a big guy named Packy kind of roughed me up in the hole in front of the Business Agent and President. They yelled at me, “that will teach you to lie you little bastard!”
I got this one job over at the West Roxbury VA welding again with a friend of mine and up on the seventh floor after a liquid lunch one day, I almost killed someone accidentally.  
This one freezing cold day in December our metal galvanized studs froze to the ground. I bent over grabbed an icy stud yanking it free with a jerk, still wearing my welding gloves I brought it over to the area where we were working to weld it in place. 
Being on an outside atrium wall seven floors above the main promenade, made it a bit tricky with ice covering our deck where we had to now lean over and weld. Seven floors below us there was a plumber cutting some copper pipe. 
As I repositioned the stud to get into a position to be welded, the damn sixteen-gauge, 8’ long, 6” wide stud slipped out of my hands since it had a little ice on it and it sailed all the way to the ground seven floors below just missing the bent over plumber. Had the stud been a foot over to the right, it might have cut off his head! 
Crazy events in life to this point filled my life up with all sorts of mayhem. However, on this one day, I may have put myself in jail for manslaughter. The dude that I almost hit came up to the seventh floor screaming at me and I emphatically apologized to him repeatedly. 	   	 
My days of liquid lunches became a thing of the past after that day! During this time-period from 1983-1989 I struggled with drinking and taking different types of doctor prescribed medications for my schizophrenia, which only made it much worse for me to function correctly.  
For years, I considered myself a guinea pig, taking all sorts of incorrect medications that were supposed to be helping my intense paranoia I had. However, nothing seemed to be working at all, some even made things much worse for me since now I believe they were the wrong ones I needed to be on eventually finding the correct drug ten years later. 
Around this period in my life, I met Carolyn Sullivan and we both fell heavily in love. Unfortunately, schizophrenia had become a full-blown disease in me and it truly reaped havoc in our lives. 
It’s unfortunate that finding love like that made me panic uncontrollable. After I ruined our relationship, I still unfortunately had to deal with the ongoing symptoms of schizophrenia and was still being treated with wrong medications which did not help with my condition whatsoever. This was a tough period in my life! 
The union jobs all had a lot of pressure built into them as well. Companies always would hire more men than they needed for a job and would keep the best 20 % best performing journeyman, heartlessly laying-off the rest who were let go regardless of their financial circumstances.  

My last Boston job I was still at the West Roxbury VA welding. With the job almost over and as I bent over to grab another frozen stud, the ice-cold wind blew up my back, as my shirt somehow became untucked from my jeans. That day I called the Union Hall in Honolulu and found out they had a 98% employment rate at their Honolulu Hall.  
That very moment I began planning my move to Hawaii. I soon sold my Broncho, then finally my 442 and dad co-signed a loan, then I flew on January 13, 1990, sight-unseen. Funny, 25 years later to the day, January 13, 2015 I flew back toward my old Hawaiian home once again!
My world would change forever as I flew to my new destination. Sight-unseen, I trusted in a higher power that life would change for the better! It did!


Chapter 12: Hawaii bound, 1990-1992
 
When I first landed in Hawaii January 13th, 1990, I actually did have a plan. I was to find an apartment in Waikiki first, then get work at the Carpenters Union Hall in Honolulu. My first place was on Keaamoku St. in Makiki, a couple of miles from Waikiki.  
I shared a room in a Makiki apartment from this 50-year-old woman who had placed an ad in the churches bulletin board. When she met me, she liked me right off, but in retrospect, I think she just wanted a younger good-looking guy around for sex.  
Two weeks in and after I rejected her advances as she applied moisturizer on my sunburned skin, she turned somewhat nasty! What also complicated things is while I was there; I went to Sandy Beach on the Windward side of the island and got hurt on a bogie-board. 
Unable to now work, I ended up hanging at her house recuperating from my injury for too much time. I eventually read an ad in the paper and found an apartment in Waikiki.  
Close to running out of money at this time, I paid first and last months’ rent in my Waikiki apartment with the property owner, John Foy. 
Having a messed-up neck and shoulder from my accident, I now had to figure out what to do next for generating income. 
I actually had previously filed an unemployment claim back in Massachusetts that kicked in during this exact moment, while collecting some VA money that was still coming in from my cuckoo check. 
The combined amounts still were not enough, so I called up an old AA sponsor and he suggested I get a union job and fake an injury right away. So far, in over ten years of working as a construction worker, I never had filed any kind of medical claim whatsoever. Therefore, I decided to go solicit a union job and see if I could still work. 
I walked onto a job in downtown Honolulu, approached the supervisor and proceeded to tell him that I was a great metal framer and that I would break my neck for him if he would hire me. 
On the first day I loaded myself up on painkillers and muscle relaxers just barely managing to get through the first day on the job because of really bad pain in my neck and right shoulder. 
Day 2 however, I inevitable was given an opportunity by an accident that seemed like divine intervention, when I worked on a wall which separated the adjoining building. 
They gave us these rickety benches instead of ladders and on one of these benches; I accidently tipped the bench over sending me sailing through the metal studs falling down into the adjoining building. 
Not only did I fall into the other building, but also while this happened my tool belt got accidently hung up on a copper pipe, flipped me upside down as I free-fell toward the floor of the adjoining building. 
Fate would have it that the accident was real and it couldn’t be doubted in its authenticity and so this worked out better than I could have possible imagined. 
I actually hung myself upside down, cracked my head on the ground knocking myself unconscious and had to be lifted off the pipe by two big Samoan dudes. 
Now bleeding they called the supervisor on a radio and within fifteen minutes an ambulance came and rushed me to the hospital. 
In actuality, I reinjured my injuries I received at Sandy’s the week before. Prior to this my only other option was to pack it up and go home, something I had no intention of doing! So, I got some balls up and did what I had to do!
So, on worker’s compensation, collecting unemployment benefits from Massachusetts and still receiving a cuckoo check from the VA, I build up enough revenue to stay and survive in Honolulu, which lasted almost another three years.  
This allowed me to continue making friends in AA and I went to plenty of meetings. Eventually however I started partying again after being sober a couple of years. 
Partying again for about eight months or so, I can remember having a ton of fun dating and raising hell with random women who were all a bit crazy too like myself.  
Eventually I returned to meetings and got another year of sobriety under my belt before I went home to Maine for a vacation to visit family. Then life would take an unusual turn with someone who would give me my own family eventually. 
During my eight-month slip I raised hell in Honolulu! Drinking, dating, screwing and partying with tourist women from all over the world. I had so much fun but at the same time I felt really lonely and missed family back home, so I occasionally would head to Massachusetts to be with family and go to Maine where my life truly would start over!
Later I was grateful that I had that experience since afterwards, I settled down to an eight-year relationship and marriage in which I proudly fathered three great kids. Which even today I am extremely close to, and I wouldn’t want it any other way!                  
At this time, I had noticed not only did I have addictions towards alcohol and some drugs, including Hawaiian weed, but also found out that I was highly sexualized and in my first two years in Honolulu, I whored around quite a bit. 
In paradise with sexy woman everywhere, clad in bikinis, I found out that dating would be a blast in Waikiki. Getting a girlfriend would however pose to be a bit tougher since many of the woman I hooked up with were just visiting tourists, here today, gone to Maui. 


Chapter 13: Meeting Mechele

Eventually I hooked up with one of my parents’ closest friends’ daughter in-law. Still in Honolulu, I decided to MAC fly it home and since I was retired military, I got to fly Space A via the Air Force for free when they had space available.  
I flew home and visited my parents who were up in there summer camp in Naples, Maine, up on Sebago Lake. Happy to see me, we all headed to our favorite beach on Sebago called Sandy Beach. Little did I know; my life was going to be impacted forever because of this unusual beach visit! 
That prior year I had been rehabbing my neck and shoulder injury working out by doing multiple sets of pushups. I got so good at them I was able to do seven sets of 75 push-ups in a row with a 5-minute rest period in-between sets. 
On two separate occasions, I doubled those seven sets to fourteen sets of 75 pushup repetitions, for a staggering 1050 push-ups done in a couple of hours. 
Later in life I was doing 315 LBS on a bench and 405 LBS on a squat, not bad considering I never used steroids of any kind. The point of me mentioning this was that I had developed such a good physique, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Mechele.  
As the boat approached the beach, I dove off the bow of my parents’ pontoon boat and swam the rest of the way into shore as I had done when I was a kid. 
As I came out of the lake she said to my mom, “Peggy, I didn’t know you had such a handsome son!” So, then it started! 
As we landed next to the Sweetland’s, friends of my parents, Mechele and her cousin Christina were there sitting on a beach blanket. Mechele was the daughter-in-law of the Sweetland’s who hung out with the whole group when they were together having cocktails.   
I can tell my dad was rather fond of her and can remember him saying to me that I needed to find a woman just like Mechele. How prophetic was that right? 
Brian the Sweetland’s son and Mechele did not have the strongest relationship and vacationed separately most of the time. Up until this point Mechele had several miscarriages in her marriage with Brian and I knew she really wanted to have kids. I came home from Hawaii to see my family and eventually stole Mechele away from their son.  
I am not proud of that fact, but it became a reality when we started our relationship while she was still married to Brian. Why not, what else to this point in my life was normal anyways? 
As my mother often prophesized to me, I would be going to hell in a hand basket. So, me breaking the tenth commandment “thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife,” seems to be a big one, but in actuality I think I broke four out of ten anyways. 
When mom was alive, I answered this retort by telling her “You’re going to hell in a hand basket” with, “I don’t care, all my friends will be there!”  
But still having kids even in this way was still my biggest and best accomplishment of my entire life, I do love them so very much and wouldn’t change a thing! So supposedly things happen for a reason, Go figure, right!
God; if he or she exists must like me to some degree because the second half of my life starting around my thirties has been a very fun adventure and I do thank whatever force has allowed me to live the life I have lived. To some degree Dad has a lot to do with that, so thanks Da! 
I should not have listened to Mechele and named Connor Freddy, as he had asked me to do. I think pussy whipped applies here possible. But in actuality, I do love the name Connor too, very much! 
What was kind-of funny about meeting Mechele that day was that I first hit on Christina, Mechele’s cousin first, asking her out to the movies that day. 
She thought I was pretty lame the way I formally asked her out. She pretty much rejected me on the spot, laughing at my clumsy proposal. 
So, after I licked my wounds a few nights later and at a club somewhere in Massachusetts while I was dancing with Mechele, watching Mechele consume several jello test-tube full of alcohol, I made my move with Mechele and began kissing her neck as we slow danced. 
Later the next day, Christina, Mechele and I, with Brian’s unbeknownst approval of our new blossoming affair, agreed that Mechele could head up to Maine with Christina and me for the week to his parents’ cabin a few hundred feet from my parents’ place without Brian’s presence.  
We hit it off right away and started having a secret affair with Christina the only one in the know of it. Both my parents and Brian’s parents had no idea what was going on.   
Well actually my mom had some inkling. She approached us one day while we watched my dad throwing horseshoes and in front of both of us said, “Chris and Mechele you two better not be fooling around with each other, you’ll be in so much trouble I swear!” 
We quickly assured her we were not. If Mechele and I were like the wooden puppet Pinocchio, our noses would have grown at least a foot. Can’t fool a mom’s intuition, I guess! 
Later toward the end of the week as the two of us were still with Christina in my parents’ mobile home, while we all sat their contemplating arrangements to get me to South Station to catch a train to Baltimore since I was heading back to Hawaii the next day via a MAC flight. I thought to myself; why not ask her if she would come back with me. 
So, I asked her and to my surprise she began debating the whole situation with Christina. She eventually said, “why not, I do not love Brian and I doubt he loves me either.” She said, “What do I have to lose?” 
Hours later she formulated a plan which involved immediately moving out of Brian’s house when she got back to Massachusetts and she did grab most of her stuff in Brian’s house when he was at work and moved into her grandmother’s house one town over.   
I began my four-day ordeal returning back to Waikiki via space A again. Staying in touch with her constantly via pay phone every chance I could. 
The next month I took a Space A flight to Boston again, this time going down to Cape Cod for a week with her. Spending that week with her was fun and we were both excited to be with each other again. Our plan was for me to go back home to Hawaii again and to send for her later the next month.  
On day two of our Cape Cod vacation, Mechele began reading the newspaper in our favorite Hyannis breakfast joint. 
She was reading the paper as I sat across from her and splashed all over the front page was the headline reporting a record marijuana bust in Boston and it read, “Fugitive Patrick O’Hearn, (named altered to protect the not so innocent)’The Weed King of New England,’ On the Run, sought by FBI and DEA agents.” 
Seeing this in the paper I almost shit a brick. I read her the article which also mentioned one of my closest friends John and his older brother Chrissy O’Hearn who were also arrested and were guys I was very close to, that I grew up with. 
Having just started a relationship with her I wondered if she had second thoughts about being with me since some of my earlier life consisted with hanging out with these crazy bastard degenerates.  
I stayed about two weeks in total appearing with her at my parent’s house in Roslindale while both parents remained in Maine. 
Ogg and my brother Timmy were sitting on the back porch and I remember Timmy asking why I was with her. I somewhat avoided a direct answer, but I think he knew what I was up to since he knew me all too well.  
So, leaving for Honolulu via Space A flight took close to four days to get me back home to Hawaii. On the way while awaiting a plane back to the islands still at Travis AFB in California I called Mechele on the phone and she asked if I were sitting down. 
I actually remember at that point sitting down, while still tethered to the pay phone receiver in a phone booth at Travis AFB which is still in the same location all these years later. 
She then went on to tell me she missed her period that she thought I might have gotten her pregnant. Shocked, but now very excited I assured her not to worry that we would still move on with our plans and she would move to Honolulu to live with me back in Waikiki as soon as we could arrange it.  
Well, her moving to Hawaii with me would eventually prove to have some obstacles. Mom called me up on the phone in Hawaii one day after she did move out with me and asked, “Chris, Mechele isn’t with you there is she?” 
Denying my mother’s intuitions again I said no way mom; all the while Mechele sat there nervously smirking and sighing under her breath.  
She made a point of telling me she had better not be with me, that she would disown me if Mechele had run away to Hawaii with me. 
At that point I said rather convincingly again, “God no mom,” somewhat reassuring her by my outright lie, “I wouldn’t do something that stupid,” I said, “Do you think I’m that crazy?”  
Not admitting to the fact that not only was she living with me, but at that moment she was sitting on the bed listening to her and was two months pregnant with my baby at that very moment. 
The pressure Brian’s parents put on both my parents and Mechele’s family to find her whereabouts eventually led to us admitting our transgressions which definitely rewrote my parents’ relationship with the Sweatland’s’ and put a huge strain on it for years to come. 
Mechele and I would start our relationship off on a big black cloud, as we became the “black sheep’s” in both of our families.  
She quickly discovered my sick schizophrenic mind unfortunately, the night she flew into Honolulu, now being a couple of months pregnant, tired from her fifteen-hour flight, she took a shower and we fooled around shortly after we arrived back home in my 32-floor apartment. 
Unknowingly I gave her a hickey on her neck while we fooled around. An hour later not remembering I had done that I got paranoid and lost my temper accusing her of screwing around. As I questioned her on why she had the hickey on her neck I punched the concrete wall above her head as she sat there now completely in shock. 
My paranoia haunted a lot of my thinking especially since close relationships posed so much profound fear in me! 
The poor thing tired, pregnant and now so confused and very stunned, began assuring me she had not fooled around on me and now devastated, asked me if she should just take the return ticket and leave. She said she could leave the next day if possible as she sat there in tears.  
Something clicked inside me and I thought about our passionate moment a short time before and started remembering that I did neck with her. Mentioning this to her she explained I must have given it to her in that moment and that since she was anemic due to her pregnancy, made her even more vulnerable to get one. 
The next day we decided to take a ride up-country and I tried to emphasize just how sorry I was. I drove; what looked basically looked like a blue windowless hacker’s van, something you’d see in a Friday the thirteenth movie or something, which had an unbolted director’s chair for a front passengers’ seat.  
So, we hit the road and leaving my driveway I hit the gas so we wouldn’t get rear-ended on the Ala Wai Blvd. Oh god to add insult to injury the damn director’s chair flipped over and she fell backwards onto my set of golf-clubs which sat behind her and she let out a noticeable painful yelp. Wow did I fuck up again! I felt sooooo horrible!!! 
Deservedly so I felt wicked bad! I spent the next couple of months trying to make it up to her! My sickness was no picnic for her and back then since I had not been diagnosed correctly yet; meant unfortunately for her that I was not treated with the right anti-psychotic meds yet. 
In actuality the right medication that I finally did get on and have now been taken successfully for the last twenty-five years or so, but hadn’t been developed until like five years after I met her and then I started taking it.
There were fun moments with Mechele in Hawaii that we both enjoyed very much. She mentioned once that having her birthday so close to Christmas usually meant she wouldn’t get a good birthday gift since her birthday was December 23. 
I took note of this and snuck out to the mall and bought two very expensive pocketbooks. I felt so good seeing her smile with an ear-to-ear grin and I followed that up with giving her another pocketbook on Christmas. She truly appreciated the effort!  
Once while swimming at Kailua beach as Mechele sat on the beach I got a jelly fish wrapped around my thigh and got stung bad. I winced and left the water and quickly ran to the shower on the boardwalk to try to rinse off the venom.  
She asked in a concerned voice what the matter was. I said to her I got stung as I turned on the shower to wash off the area; when all of a sudden, the shower shot a laser of pressurized water down on me in a stream of water since someone had removed the shower head and it hit me right in the nuts!  
I fell on the ground now in total agony now and I remember her laughing so hard she pissed her pants. But not to be outdone by that one, at Sunset beach on the North Shore she by herself decided to pee in the ocean being four months pregnant and she thought it was a good idea to sit in a beach chair for comfort I guess and pee nonchalantly in the ocean.  
 	I warned her over and over about the surf that day, but she didn’t listen and got pounded by a pretty sizeable wave that mercilessly got her, that is, being flipped ass over tea-kettle off the chair and slammed her on the beach pretty hard. Not too happy was she on that day either I’ll tell you!                                               
           
 Another Visit to the VA Kookoo House during our marriage as years into our relationship had passed so I decided to seek out good psychiatric help and I put myself into the VA hospital in Togus, Maine. 
My first week was met with some strange trepidation as to how I would act in a group counseling setting.  
I was in trouble there immediately in an open meeting with several other patients while the therapist sat there nervously trying to control the scene. I inadvertently started a fistfight in my first group therapy session. 
This one veteran was wining on and on about his wife and whether or not she still loved him or not. Normally listening to this would have been easy since I had previous experience at AA meetings, but honest to God, he sounded like a whiny little bitch sobbing like a fucking three-year-old. 
I am not being insensitive either; even the therapist prodded the man to act a little more adult-like and stop acting like a child.  
Well after ten minutes of this guy holding us all total hostages with his incessant crying, I spoke up and said out loud, “Jesus’ man, grow a fucking pair why don’t you!” At which point he leapt off his chair and swung at me.  
Well, seconds later after I knocked him down with a right hook, a damn siren sounded as I was now forced out into the hallway and I decided to head back into the ward. 
For some reason the door locked immediately as I entered the ward, so I began booting the thick metal reinforced door as hard as I could, which was now locked leaving me stranded in the unit.  
A minute later, the latch unlocked eerily all of a sudden and I began to open the door cautiously, when suddenly four hospital security personnel holding nightsticks had instructed me to calm down.  
 I was none too happy but to oblige, since I had my own previous run-ins with nightsticks before. Escorted to a locked ward and summarily shot up with Thorazine, I slept until the next evening and awoke really out of it. It took me 15 minutes to traverse a 30’ hallway back to my ward and all I wanted to do was to sleep some more.
My doctor who was the head psychiatrist gathered the patients around the ward meeting hall every morning for a patient doctor meeting. 
During the morning session he reported that in a few days, one of the senior patients would be leaving the ward where he had been living for the past three years or so. He was angered and deeply saddened by this and became very distraught.  
After hearing this guy sob a little, I decided to write an opinion as to why this veteran should stay at the Togus VA. 
I took it upon myself to speak at the following patient doctor ward meeting the next day from this well-prepared statement I had carefully crafted. 
That statement stated that this man would be caused immediate unnecessary emotional pain if forced to leave, given the fact that he had been at the ward for three years and had many friends there, with no other family members to speak of. 
As I presented my speech in the morning meeting, all eyes were upon me and actually had the doctor’s full attention too. 
Later that afternoon during my one-on-one doctor-patient session, he privately suggested that I become the president of the ward and as he asked me, I watched his face smirk and also watched him fight off laughing out loud.  
This was the perfect opportunity to prove to this doctor once and for all I really wasn’t playing with a full deck, which in reality I wasn’t anyways. 
At stake was the possibility of me getting diagnosed with a permanent disability as having schizoaffective disease and receive a 100% permanent and total disability the rest of my life, which would guarantee me income and full medical, with dental the rest of my life.  
My kids would also be eligible to receive tuition stipends as they attended college in the future as well. Seeing how my disability also had placed me inside other psychiatric wards before, in actuality it had already been determined I would get 100% permanent disability since it was predetermined that my disability was service connected. 
Me writing this speech basically was from the heart. I was his advocate and I felt for him. My manic state of mind actually believed I could sway the head psychiatrists into extending his stay for some time. I really was gun-ho after just getting out of my college responsibilities; so, using my brain although it was still schizoaffective, I thought could help him back then.  
Nonetheless, this poor guy was removed from our ward and put in a veteran’s retirement home down the street from where the hospital was located. My efforts although failing, painted me in an unusual light in my doctors’ eyes as being just a very compassionate, but very manic patient with a big heart, which in actuality bolstered my chance of getting the 100% retirement that I eventually ended up with.  
Therefore, I became the de facto President of my ward, and a title I held near and dear to my heart. Okay, I’m not that much of a whack job; but hey, being the president served three purposes; One: help convince the Doctors I was flipping nuts. Two: get on their good side as I had kind of pissed them off by my several tirades I had while I was locked up. 
Three: I was able to have fun knowing the doctors watched my every move and in reality, I didn’t have to try very hard convincing anybody of my mental incompetency anyways, because I am really kind of nuts in actuality! 
The ward I lived in for close to 45 days was filled with kooky veterans who were pranksters like myself. One day after Mechele and my kids left the ward on a visit, I decided I had to go into the bathroom to brush my teeth after she brought in an Italian submarine sandwich.   
As I approached the bathroom, two of the weirder patients sat on some chairs positioned right outside the bathroom door. They seemed to me to be just a little too happy and gleeful to see me and I pondered exactly what these two characters were up to. 
I shook my head and proceeded into the bathroom almost stepped on one of the biggest turds I had ever seen in my entire life!   
This thing must have been at least a foot long and was massively thick. I immediately gagged and threw-up a little in my mouth. 
I turned around, stepping over the behemoth and preceded to walk out of the john without brushing my teeth and those two fools were laughing openly in their full glory as disgusting pranksters I knew them to be.  
Even though this was the typical retards I had to temporarily live with, in reality it wasn’t so bad though. The fact that I was inside gave me a chance to further reevaluate life living the rest of it being on medications I badly needed.  
On one of my weekend passes home; however, which was now wintertime in Maine, I noticed Ingo the German property owner of our complex walking up our pathway toward our apartment at 9:30 at night. 
Having spent the previous month locked up 70 miles away I immediately became suspicious that perhaps Mechele and Ingo may have been bumping uglies while I was locked up in the looney bin.  
In reality however, I found out Ingo; after questioning him for several minutes outside my front door was there walking down my pathway at 9:30 at night to make sure the door to the laundry room was closed and locked and he used my side walk to access the back of the building. 
Temperatures were going down below 20 degrees below zero that night and frozen pipes would have been a costly repair. 
He was not there to have sex with Mechele. The ongoing joke my son and I have is that we say that Ingo is his real dad. Connor laughs and says, “My real dad (Ingo) has more money than you anyways and he would buy me way more cool things than you! Huh, you “Wiseass,” I called him!
 	Truth be told, when Connor was 14, he had like a 13-size shoe and was already close to 6” tall and the Ingo story still echoed in my paranoid skull. So, I did what any rational schizophrenic would do and give my son a DNA test.  
	I explained it to him like this. I loved him so much and no matter what, he was my son! But I had to know if he was my DNA for real, but regardless, I loved him forever!
	Well according to DNA results back then there was like a 99.999987% I was his biological father. I remember showing him the results and we highfied, and he said I love you dad but you are just crazy!  


Chapter 14: My Three Amigos

	     Kelsey came first!
My kids were my greatest lifetime accomplishment! When Mechele told me she was pregnant on my way home to Hawaii from Cape Cod at the Travis Air Force terminal, on a public telephone, I could not have been happier. 
You know how they say things are meant to be, this one instance I agree with them. Mechele came to Hawaii two months pregnant, felt homesick, so we compromised and we left Hawaii five months later and landed in Orlando in April of 1992.  
Instead of a thirteen-hour plane ride, family would now only have a four-hour flight to come see us. In Orlando, I bought a house and we remodeled it to our liking, with me putting in an irrigation system and the nicest lawn in the neighborhood.   
I was supposed to come home and be my brother’s best man, but his wedding date was near the time Mechele was having our first child. 
June 22 for me was a restless night, as Mechele apparently began nesting and attempted to put up a border in the 2nd bedroom and complained about pain, which I thought was the baby coming.  
That night her water broke and we left for the hospital all very excited. Linda, Mechele’s aunt was with us and we all went to the hospital where Mechele on June 23, I believe around 7am, had Kelsey.  	 
That morning during labor, Mechele started grunting loudly and squeezed my hand every time she had contractions. 
I for at least 35 minutes during this stage had to poop and every time she started contracting squeezing my hand and grunting loudly, made me feel as though I was going to shit my pants. 
Once she started crowning to 10 cm and was ready to deliver, I just could not take any more of it. I asked the Doctor if I had five minutes and Mechele screamed, “You’re fucking kidding me, right?!?” Lucky for me, the bathroom was attached to the delivery room, which allowed me after to witness all the excitement. 
Kelsey was born and I immediately got my mom on the phone as the doctor was stitching up her episiotomy she had during the birth. 
Again, she screamed, “Are you fucking kidding me right now (?),” when I asked her to say hi to my mom on the phone.  
So, having Kelsey for me meant I was a new dad and now had more responsibility. That following month I took a real estate course and got a job at Coldwell Banker as a Realtor in Orlando. 
Having a little bit of cash left over from a workman’s comp case I settled and still had VA money coming in monthly, I still had a little more time to get established.  
Summer in Florida was always so hot! In addition, we always had to worry about hurricanes hitting us at any time. When August came, I found myself struggling to get listings as a new agent working for Coldwell Banker. I began contemplating looking for construction work as I had done in the past to support my new family. 
We heard news alerts about the possibility of a hurricane coming into our area. We were going to be okay since we lived inland about 45 miles east off the coast in Orlando. As the storm approached, the reports we started receiving let us know it was going to be an intense storm. 
Hurricane Andrew was at the time of its occurrence in August 24, 1992, the most destructive hurricane in United States history. It caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was in South Florida, where it made landfall at Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds up to 165 mph. passing directly through the town of Homestead, Florida, a town south of Miami.  
Andrew obliterated entire blocks of homes in Homestead and in many cases left only the concrete foundations in its wake. Over 25,000 houses were destroyed in Miami-Dade County alone, and nearly 100,000 more were severely damaged. 65 people were killed and the damage total across the affected regions exceeded $26 billion. 
Times for me were such that I had to make a move. I decided then that I was going to start a drywall business and went about getting a Drywall contractor’s license that required me taking a test. 
Dade County after the hurricane saw a lot of structural damage due to the substandard building practices because of weak building codes and enforcement practices of that area. That resulted in catastrophic building damage that might have been avoided with stricter building codes and its enforcement.  
Because the prior building codes were not up to nation-wide industry standards, Dade County hastily prepared tests for all of the trades, with drywall and metal framing being one of them. 
I took a 20-question test and quickly filled in my answers, some of which were basic test questions, others were a little more involved. I remember getting back the results in Miami and I had just flunked it by ten points.  
I went to the testing office in Miami and went to the licensing bureau and basically confronted the author of the test who was not even a carpenter, nor had the skills required to write specific questions that applied to metal framing.  
After a while, I eventually got on the phone with him again about the test and suggested more relevant test questions, replacing his unknowledgeable test questions with questions that involved actual state codes that formed pertinent questions. 
He rewrote the test questions and corresponding correct answers, after which I retook the exam, and of course aced it. 
The man who originally made up the drywall and drywall-framing test had a handyman’s knowledge of the processes required for the skills necessary to do the job professionally, with no real knowledge of the technical aspects of what really were building codes accepted in the majority of US states.   
In the end I taught him about accepted US codes for what it would take to create the necessary fire codes in various types of buildings which were at necessary to create an hour fire rating burn-survival time and how much layered drywall it would take. 
I also Taught him about what the codes were on what gauge thickness metal studs were required on interior and exterior walls, plus some board framing techniques acceptable in arches and codes and for their necessary bracing, as well as correct screw field patterns, which all were code in most other states as well.  
After getting my license, it now meant that I had to advertise for workers and screen out the throngs of workers pouring into the state to rebuild South Florida. 
I actually made a good living for the next two years, but in the interim, Mechele, the baby (Kelsey) and I moved to Ft. Lauderdale and rented out our home up in Orlando so I would be closer to my future construction jobs.  
Moving closer to Miami for me meant I could drive home every night and not spend weeks away at a time from my family. Before the move to Orlando, I bought a Chevy van, built a toolbox in the back that doubled as a bed. 
I went to a trailer dealership, bought a trailer bed mattress from the dealer, and spent two nights at a time in the van, discreetly showering at the gym near the beach in Hollywood, Florida right on the boardwalk. 
The apartment complex we moved to was very nice. It had an Olympic size pool and the weather was always beautiful. 
Kelsey was such a good baby girl and I would often take her to the pool and wade with her in the warm pool waters.  
Coincidently, my cousin Lynn had a baby girl actually the night before Andrew hit and Mechele and Lynn became friends and our daughters hung out often together. 
One day at the pool I decided to sit at the edge of the pool with Kelsey in the shallow end, still over her head at 3’ deep though. 
Kelsey could speak somewhat fluently and I sat her on the edge of the pool, telling her to stay there while I dove into the still waters of the warm pool. 
Kelsey and I were the only ones there that day, so we had the pool all to ourselves. “Kelsey” I said, “You sit here and don’t move, Okay?”  
She said, “Yes daddy,” as I dove into the clear warm pool, began swimming underwater as I had always done and as I got close to twenty feet away, still underwater, I heard a splash. Knowing I was there with just Kelsey alone, I stood up quickly and at first, I could not see her at all. 
I then dove frantically underwater again, swimming furiously back toward Kelsey, swam up to her, and I’ll never forget what I saw.                                                 
Her big beautiful blue eyes were wide open. She kind of reminded me of tweaty-bird, the cartoon bird character we watched on tv as kids. Her eyes stayed wide-open and tiny bubbles escaped from her clenched cheeks, as I noticed her staring at me as I rescued her from the bottom of the pool.  
As we resurfaced, she first let out the big breath she was holding, followed by a nervous whine that she bellowed out from her scared and shaking little body. 
She was such a good kid! I remember when she was two her always asking me to put her down for a nap around 1 in the afternoon. She made me sing the na-night song Mechele and I made up for her that she loved so much. Everything in her life was on a routine; Mechele demanded that of us as parents. Mechele was a good mother and we had fun for the most part.  

I was so relieved that she was okay and I quietly asked her why she did not listen to me when I told her to sit there. 
Her answer she gave to me was that she wanted to jump in as I had done. Immediately we went to the shower and I calmed her down rinsing the pool water off her and reassured her she would be okay. Telling mom was a different story however, I avoided that for years I think until Kelsey had her 5th birthday.  
Kelsey assumed the big sister role as she was in charge of her younger siblings. The dynamics within the three kids was rather strange. As they got older, Kelsey really bonded with her younger brother Connor. At times, they were thick as thieves, often hanging out with each other. 
Kenzie was always a part of it as well, butting in whenever she pleased, strongly opinionated, she drove the other two a little nuts.  
Connor and Kelsey are very much alike, whereas Kenzie seemed to be a bit more independent, never seeking for her sibling’s approval for anything. 
All three of the kids are exceptionally smart; the difference being that Kenzie has always been driven. If Kenzie woke up at three in the morning and felt as though she needed to do more studying for a test or something, she would have dragged herself up, even though she was dog-ass tired.  
One time coming from our hike up Douglas Mountain, near Sebago Lake in Maine. Connor had to use the porta-potty at the parking lot before we left for home. 
Being a wiseass, I decided to pull up to the porta potty and beep my horn as I bumped the porta potty.
         He came running out with his pants down to his knees screaming at me at the top of his lungs! Needless to say, he wasn’t too pleased!
I broke up the long ride back to Mechele by playing the mint game. That was, who could keep a mint in their mouth without letting it melt or eating it. Kelsey would always win!
Who remembers the route 11 + 25 car Jump?
	
	I would come down this hill or go the other way and at the intersection of route 11 and 25 do about 30-40 mph and get airborne over the hill.
	We’d approach the area and I’d announce to them, “Let’s hit it.” They’d scream “YES” and we launched over the intersection getting some good air under us!
There is still a little sibling rivalry between all three if you ask me, but within normal limits I would say. Connor and Kelsey have so much potential and like me will come into their own a little later in life as I had done. 
Connor however tends to always look at life to see; as the saying goes, “If the grass is greener on the other side, but now am noticing that as he approaches 23 that he is getting much more ambitious!”  
Connor left the Air Force at 28 after he did 10 years in. He can still get his 20 and his pension if he goes Civil Service and buys back his time, something he is seriously considering!
He then will be able to write his own ticket and work anywhere he wants, plus have a huge check rolling in every month and lay back and not have too much anxiety with work anymore. 
I explained to him that today, everyone has to worry about how companies today have no loyalty toward their employees and outsourcing and layoff of employees is common place. I think this boy listens to me, thank God!!!!
Kelsey is such a great person, loving, loyal, dedicated and generous too. All three kids are wonderful, as they have turned out all great which makes me proud since I consider myself a hands-on dad. 
I did participate in raising the kids and proudly never shirked my responsibilities as I have seen countless other fathers do, completely shirking their own fatherly duties. Not me, I was raised better than that! 
I always saw Mackenzie achieving anything she put her mind to. Her potential is limitless, as I bet, she will undoubtedly prove to all of us. She already has seen much success and I am fine with Kenzie staying as a nurse. After all, passing her nursing boards the first shot is a testament to just how smart she really is!
Plus being a nurse, which will always be in demand, is an honorable, caring occupation and she is capable of earning a great future income doing this! 
Potentially she can achieve any other goals she wishes, as she has the strong will of the Lion. We both were born four days apart in July and since we are both Leos’, we both have a tremendous fire inside us.

Back in South Florida
Things were humming along and a couple of years into our stay, I ran into a huge roadblock. The Fig Leaf Restaurant was a restaurant in a building boom in the Art Deco District on Miami Beach that I rebuilt in 1993. I designed a system of arches by a method I called board framing.  
We framed and drywalled all of the interior walls and built over 1000 linear feet of arches, completing the project two weeks early. We did an outstanding job, but when we completed the project, I asked for my final draw to pay my workers and pay for the rest of my materials from my vendor, when the General Contractor refused to pay me because he discovered I placed my lean five days too late.  
He owed me over $14,000 and when I approached him that final time, we almost came to blows, but since there were four of them and I was alone and one flashed a gun, trying to intimidate me, telling me no one would miss me if I were dead.  
I left his office totally discouraged and headed to court and called the Better Business Bureau, who both said I did not stand a chance getting the rest paid to me since the owner of the building filed bankruptcy and could not pay the general contractor anything and that my lean wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on since it was filed legally too late.  
So, I managed to pay my workers out of pocket, which wiped out my bank account and we were left owing my supplier, with no way to pay them their $7,000 I owed. 
Caught in a huge bind, we decided to leave Florida and head to Boston. Mechele thought her girlfriend would take us in for a while, but as we got there, Heidi changed her mind.                                	 
         Heading back to Boston        
As we got 600 miles away from our destination, Mechele after talking to Heidi told me Heidi changed her mind, that she did not want our family moving in with her. This was now a nightmare in the working!  
We ended up going to Boston and catching my mom by surprise, when I asked her if we could move home for a while.   
Apparently, mom was pissed, and as moms’ often do, they vent to her other kids which was in this case Timmy. She dumped on me as she told Timmy of her deep displeasure of us disrupting her life and that got Tim fired up and he took it upon himself to say something to me as I arrived first thing at the house.
Timmy called the house the night of our arrival and began giving me a real hard time about me disturbing our parents’ lives. He called me some terrible insulting things and I blew my top. 
I slammed the kitchen phone down hanging up in a huff, got in my car and drove four streets up to Timmy’s house, got out and began pounding on his door. 
I did not realize that Timmy lived one house over and I inadvertently began pounding on Ogg’s downstairs tenants’ house. Ogg opened his door and screamed at me asking what the hell I was doing. He said Timmy lived one door over, so I ran over to Tim’s house and began pounding on his door. 
He came out and we started going at it, at least I did, because Timmy was reluctant at fighting me because I was so mad. 
I threw a couple of punches and so did he when my mother showed up saw what was happening and screamed for us to stop. I did and returned home seething. 
Finding out later, mom had complained loudly to Timmy about us coming home and he took it upon himself to be her defender.  
From my point of view, my company went broke due to the general contractor ripping me off the $14,000. I couldn’t even get any more materials down there since I was black-balled by drywall suppliers all throughout south Florida, since I walked away leaving my supplier without paying and therefor couldn’t get any more jobs in South Florida. 
We intended to go to Heidi’s house, but I found out Mechele just assumed Heidi would take us in temporarily, but she never actually agreed to it. What a mess!  
So, while we were on the road, I found out that we actually did not have a place to go. Eventually things worked out okay, I guess. My mom accepted our arrival as a mixed blessing.  
On one hand, she liked shopping with Mechele occasionally drinking wine with her as they shopped and lunched together.   
The fact that I came back when I did, saved their damn house from sewer rats that got into the house walls from an empty toilet port left open after the broken toilet was removed, not replaced, and stuffed with a rag that was supposed to stop vermin from entering from the Boston sewer system. 
After replacing the toilet with a new one and pest control baited traps all over, it eventually cleared up after I took down walls and ceilings removing corpses and reinstalling the drywall after.  
However, dealing with the one problem of the bait traps that was caused the rats to eat the bate led them to dying in the walls. The damn rats all died within the walls and ceilings all inside her house, leaving a god-awful stench throughout the whole house.  
I remember going upstairs and the stench was so bad, my eyes actually began watering. My mom begged me to do something which meant I had to use an electric Sawzall to cut through the plaster walls and remove the rat corpses.  
Well, the day I attempted to resolve the issue I saw my parents drive away heading to the VA for a psychiatric appointment for my dad since he was so depressed after his debilitating stroke. 
As they drove off, I started my Sawzall up and began cutting into the plaster wall. Not knowing where the plumbing lines were, I accidentally struck and cut a cold-water pipe in two, causing an immediate flood on the second-floor bathroom and all the rooms downstairs.  
Immediately I began looking in the basement for the main water shutoff valve, but after 15 long minutes, I still could not find it. Eventually with the help of my new neighbor Kenny, I found it and finally shut it off.  
OMG, what a mess, (!) all the ceilings downstairs were ruined. I had inadvertently caused close to $10,000 worth of damage estimated by the insurance company. Explaining this to mom and dad was not going to be easy or so I thought. Before they got home, I did remove six dead rats from the walls, puking all the while when I did it.
She actually didn’t have a bad reaction to my misdeed. Uncle Joe came over the next day and rigged the pipe as if it had somehow cracked due to a freeze. 
The insurance paid my mom $10,000 and I was now hired as the drywall guy to demo and fix the damage which included most of the downstairs ceilings. The end result was that I rebuilt all the downstairs ceilings which came out brand new and rebuilt the original room that had the dead rats in it. 
Having to replace all of the downstairs ceilings was really a blessing since all of the ceilings were original and were all cracked plaster that also had rat corpses in each of them as well. 
The kitchen ceiling was hard to figure out. The original plaster ceiling had several layers in it and was over five inches thick and removing it left the walls five inches short as well.  
I rebuilt the kitchen ceiling with a combination of framing, 5/8” sound insulation board, sound resilient channel and finally a double layer of 5/8” drywall. 
Now finished and painted with her new beautiful light-fan fixture wired, hooked up and properly hung, everyone sat in the kitchen as I bragged at how the kitchen ceiling provided total noise protection from the floor above. 
What is funny about this was while I was bragging about my great ceiling I built and how soundproof it now was. My dad fell off the toilet upstairs and was banging on the floor for help for like ten minutes.  
Finally, as I left the kitchen and walked to the front door, I actually could now hear the pounding on the bathroom floor and rescued my poor Da. 
So, end result, I did all of the work myself and it cost in total like $3,000 with me making some of the money too. So, mom got new ceilings, rats all gone, no more smell and pocketed $7,000. I think she made out all right with me being home! 
Timmy and I had that blowout and I knew that we still loved each other, although our relationship was a little strained. He apologized, I refinished his ceilings in his living room with blue-board, and I re-plastered them for him at cost. I think we made amends! 
I eventually started school at Wentworth after completing an Upward Bound College prep course put on by the VA down at U-Mass Boston. 
In Upward bound, as a final project the course required that I make a research paper and I chose to do mine on the overuse of antibiotics on livestock which resulted from the use of Monsanto’s new drug called RBST or growth hormones which were used on livestock; which Monsanto; who cornered this market, influenced farmers to put it in cows feed to produce more milk and meat.  
The paper included, that cows given RBST or growth hormones; which were exclusively produced by the Monsanto corporation, would allow cows to produce more milk and they were routinely kept on a milking machine for a much longer period of time. 
These poor cows then would come down with mastitis or infections in their utters, because of the extended periods of time on milking machines which they were forced to be on, all in the name of the almighty buck! 
Common treatment for mastitis was lots of antibiotics for these milking cows, which cured their infections quickly getting them back online so farmers could get even bigger milk yields, which led to maintaining higher profits.   
The overuse of antibiotics in livestock for the treatment of mastitis in over milked cows led to the passing of trace amounts of antibiotics from livestock indirectly into humans through the digestion of milk and meat.  
Getting small doses of antibiotics is a huge problem for humans since this causes antibiotic resistance in our bodies which makes us immune from their beneficial qualities for their ability for fighting off infections and is often a death sentence in most humans since antibiotics are often the last line of defense against common infections.  
Inadvertently when we use antibiotics, the antibiotics kill a majority of the bacteria. However, those parts still alive within the bacteria itself, live-on an develop itself to be a dominate new super-strain within the bacteria. 
New bacteria strains grow and redevelop into new strains that are immune from the benefits of old antibiotics. These new strains of bacteria grow unchecked turning into infections that the body or medicines can’t combat.  
Trace amounts of antibiotics passing to humans through livestock inevitable make antibiotics useless to combat these new bacteria strains and now normal infections that use to be treated by penicillin for instance, are no longer effective and can lead to higher mortality rates for humans. Antibiotic resistance kills people frequently and is now a huge problem! 
The prior head of the Monsanto Corporation was somehow elected and now chosen to be the head of the FDA, (food and Drug Administration) and streamlined the approval process of the RBST drug through the FDA, with Monsanto having the sole pattern to produce this steroid, making them very rich. Talk about a conflict of interest which the paper focused on. 
You can bet lobbyist bribed the legislators to elect this man to be the head of the FDA so Monsanto could have their man running the show. 
The powerful people and corporations often use the lobbying system to put influential people in positions of power and decision-making positions, which inevitable lead them to somehow making more money for the corporations they secretly work for and are stock-holders benefitting even more. Talk about a conflict of interest which was a huge part of the paper! 
I even liked Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont back in 1990 as he had outlawed the use of RBST in Vermont, citing the many dangers it had in humans, as well as mentioning that this causes an even bigger problem because of the trace amounts of antibiotics which get passed into humans through milk and meat, thus making people resistant to the benefits of antibiotics. 
My paper made it as the sample paper for all future students to see, which still makes me very proud! 
My college education had been spread out over a number of years, with stints of time at Wentworth University of Technology, then University of Maine and finally at St. Joseph’s College in Maine. I may continue my education for a higher degree in either economics or politics. 
I very much love politics and wrote another book called, “Building a Green Capitalist Society with Trickle-Up Economics.”  I hope people will read this since it is so informative and factual. 
In it I develop an economic system that I call Trickle-Up Economics, lifting the middle class up, while showing us steps to change our energy sources into cleaner greener energy sources such as solar, thus combatting greenhouse gasses and cleaning our environment up thus potentially saving our planet. 
When Kelsey was one, we moved home to Roslindale with my parents. After Upward Bound, a VA college prep course at U-Mass Boston, I got into Wentworth Institute of technology. 
It was a strange feeling being in a college environment after the life I had led but found out at the time that I had a yearning for higher education. I loved learning and did way above average with a GPA hovering around 3.75. 
During this time and after completing two semesters at Wentworth, Kenzie was born. She was born on a warm summer day, July 27, 1994. 
I was working over In Burlington ten miles away from our house doing drywall framing again, when I got the call. 
I flew home, took a five-minute shower and during my shower I got hell from both Mechele and my mom, who offered to drive Mechele to the hospital, but Mechele was scared shit of Peggie’s driving.  
    
Driving 70 mph down the infamous J-Way, we just got into the hospital room as our doctor came in putting on one of his latex gloves, when he realized that it was too late and pulled the one glove off his hand and began assisting Mechele who delivered Mackenzie in a matter of seconds. 
She arrived exactly at 12 noon, a lunchtime baby with a full head of black curly hair. She was a cute baby and I could not have been prouder!  
Mackenzie was a fun child who always tested my patients. As a baby one time, Mimi took us to dinner and we went to a steak house in Dedham. 
As we were all seated, Kenzie started screaming at the top of her lungs because she was teething. Mimi gave Mechele one look and she immediately left the table with Kenzie and went out to the car, but Kenzie did not stop screaming. Feeding her was Mechele’s sole responsibility usually since she was breastfed.  
I concocted a story that I told Mechele that all five of us, meaning my siblings and I were all breastfed. I lied of course, because I knew breastfeeding meant Mechele would be the one to have to get up in the middle of the night to feed our kids, allowing me to sleep through without interruption.  
However, in reality, my mom never breastfed any of us, so I guess you could call that a white lie. Eventually Mechele discovered I made that story up and she just said I was a real piece of work.  
Fifteen minutes later after eating quickly, I relieved Mechele and stayed in the car with Kenzie, letting Mechele go in and eat her dinner. 
Kenzie was a handful as a child. She looked like a little China doll and Mechele always dressed them up so nice with little dresses as she spent a small fortune on them. Well, Mechele always wanted children and she was a pretty good mom to boot, I guess! 
Years later, when she was in kindergarten in Orlando, I got a strange call from her teacher. She was distraught as she tried explaining to me that Kenzie had gotten her head stuck in a child’s pretend baby carriage. 
I think the teacher was Haitian or something and I really could not understand what the hell she was talking about, so I left my house for the two-mile ride, driving quickly wondering what the hell I would see when I got there.   
I got there to see Mackenzie with her head stuck inside what appeared to be a toy version of a baby carriage. 
She was not in too much distress given her circumstances, but I just stood there for a brief second, wondering what I was going to do to get her out. 
The Haitian School teacher contemplated calling the fire department which would have been really too much of an overkill in my opinion. 
My only course of action was to take the handle of the carriage and pull the handle as hard as I could, stretching it out with my bare hands, as the teacher began pulling Mackenzie’s legs to free her. Kind of like Winnie the Pooh getting stuck in the tree trying to get the honey from the bee nest.  
You should have seen it; her hair at the time was like a thick mop, with curls galore. And just after I pulled her out, with big tears on her cheeks, she jumped up and hugged me really hard. I just chuckled, picked her up, hugged and gentle kissed her face and asked her if she was okay. 
She had enough that day, so I took Kenzie and Connor home with me as Kelsey stayed in school the rest of the day.  
Mackenzie once while she was outside of Mimi’s mobile home in Maine disturbed a bee’s nest and got stung like four times. 
The poor girl screamed in pain and I came running out of the trailer to see about twenty pissed off bees flying all around her. 
Poor Kenzie had a very swollen lip, it was so swollen perhaps as much as three inches and I was worried she may be having an allergic reaction to the bee venom.  
With my mom there, we all jumped into my truck and headed over to the hospital. I think they shot her with Benadryl and they assured us the swelling would eventually go down. 
But since it took over two hours there in the ER, everyone was so hungry and we had not eaten dinner yet. We then went into the restaurant across from the hospital and we all went inside. Kenzie’s lip was still very swollen and she was none too happy to be going out in public.  
One of the first weekend visits after the divorce, I took the kids into Bray’s Brewpub in Naples. My kids generally behaved well, but that one night I recall threatening the kids with a visit to the bathroom for a spanking if they all didn’t behave really well.  
They responded by behaving so well and I was so proud at how they didn’t make any noise whatsoever as they were distracted by drawing with their crayons the waitress had supplied to them with. 
As we finished up our meal, the man next to us with his dinner guests all listening in, complimented the kids in how well behaved they acted. 
The man said this aloud and since he was so impressed, he then offered to buy the kids their own dessert. I said thank you to him, but that it would not be necessary I said. 
But he insisted and now the kids all pleaded with me to let him. I eventually said yes and he graciously bought them each their own desert. They truly were all really great kids as even today I am truly lucky to have them! 
Every Friday night I would meet Mechele in Kennebunk since I took the kids every weekend and brought the kids for Italian food at a place called the Macaroni Grill near the mall. 
The place we went to was great and it had kid’s meals on the menu, making it even more affordable which they enjoyed. The manager one night sat down at our table and started talking to us.  
Her name was Hope and she was a wonderful woman. She told me how as a kid her and her siblings would meet their dad who was also divorced from their mom and went with him every weekend to restaurants as we did. She told me she could see I was a good dad and I enjoyed that compliment completely.  
We went to the Grill often and no matter what the crowd was that night, she always sat us all right away. She even played a game with Connor where she put him to work rolling up silverware and he enjoyed doing it. 
Kenzie eventually hated our Friday night ritual at the Macaroni Grill and insisted I break up the routine by going other places. Nevertheless, the Grill was always our favorite!
Before our divorce and subsequent permanent separation, I was in charge of the kids since Mechele worked at Home Depot down the street from the house in Orlando. I was kind of like Mr. Mom, if you will, and I had my hands full. Connor was still in diapers, so I did change quite a bit of those stinky little things, phew!   
I remember Connor pooped and I bribed Kelsey $20 to change his diaper. She sat down, untapped his diaper and screamed as she held her breath and said, “no way” and threw the $20 down on the floor and ran off in a huff. I laughed and held my breath as it was a stinky one. 
Kenzie was a funny kid! She had such a great sense of humor and every time we started playing football or basketball, which we did often, she would steal the damn ball and sit on it proclaiming it was her egg and she had to hatch it by sitting on it like a mother hen. 
Connor and I would get furious at her and always began kicking it from underneath her, trying to dislodge it as she squawked like a nervous old hen. We had so much fun! 
In the beginning with just Kelsey, we first lived in Orlando Florida where she was born. We then moved to Ft Lauderdale Florida, moved to Boston having Kenzie, moved to Maine having Connor and moved back to Orlando, but eventually ended up back in Maine where we had a house built in Sebago Lake Estates with a VA loan. 
However, within three months we separated, then quickly divorced. In all we had eight sometimes trying but still great years together when Mechele and I finally threw in the towel.  
Mackenzie during our short stay in our first new house in Naples, Maine had always watched a cartoon called the Rugrats. They all watched this as a regular thing, but Kenzie especially took a liking to it. 
One day as Mechele and I sat in the media room we heard a succession of a bunch of quick thuds, followed by a big bang.  
Apparently, Mackenzie watched an episode on Rugrats that portrayed Chucky and Tommy sliding down his stairs inside a plastic laundry basket and as he neared the bottom, he grabbed the handrail post and swung around onto the floor safely. 
Around noon, Mechele and I heard loud noises, followed up with a loud bang and then heard a loud whine in the other room. Apparently, Kenzie imitated Chuckie’s feat, but unlike Chucky could not maneuver the corner and slammed head first into the wall creating a huge dent in the new drywall wall.  
I ran out quickly to see her and she was scared shaking nervously awaiting our strong condemnation and scolding. She quickly apologized and we both looked at her shaking our heads. 
We asked her why she did it and she explained the episode of Chucky doing it, so I just told her never to try it again, got out my drywall tools and fixed the huge wall dent. 
Mackenzie was so self-motivated that she pushed herself to go to college and even managed to work while she did it. 
I am so proud of her accomplishments! Kenzie can do anything she puts her mind to and I really am grateful for Matt’s parents especially Matt’s mom, along with Matt’s grandmother who were both nurses themselves and such great influences in Mackenzie success. 
After the divorce when the kids were still children, I sold the house we all lived in, paid Mechele and my debts off and built my own house by myself that became home for us for thirteen years.
   
It became the only real home and source of stability ever in their lives. They would travel to Maine almost every week to see me and they all seemed content with that arraignment.  
Using my first set of plans I drew up for my first house after modifying them a bit, I used it to build my own house by myself, since I was an old union carpenter years before.  
With the help of a small crew, we built the main structure that was 38’ long by 28’ wide. Eventually I designed and built an addition too, that was 28’ by 24’ wide with mom financing the whole thing since I promised I would take care of her until she died, which I did.
I actually met a neighbor who was a carpenter that the kids nicknamed Marshal Farts. Between the two of us we built the addition which included a garage with an in-law apartment above complete with its own very beautiful kitchen, bathroom and a 24’ by 15’ bedroom-living room. 
 
	    	 
        
	           Connor Days
Connor was born in Portland Maine May 25, 1996 in Maine Medical Center. Mackenzie and Kelsey were so excited to see him and I have this one picture with all five of us in the picture with a very excited Mackenzie looking astonished holding her baby brother wrapped in a blue blanket.  
I remember driving into the hospital earlier that day and seeing the buds of all the trees on this unusually warm day and I said to Mechele kiddingly saying to her, “Too bad we weren’t going to the beach today, it’s beautiful!” Mechele got pissed and snapped, “Maybe you can go to the fucking beach and I’ll just deliver this baby all by myself, okay?” 
 
In the hospital the next day, a nurse retrieved Connor from the nursery and in front of Mechele, Kelsey, Mackenzie and I, she openly gushed that Connor was the most hung baby she had ever seen, saying this now smiling, staring in my direction.  I wonder in her demented mind what she thought? Like father like son?
My reaction at first was priceless! I said as a proud father; now a little embarrassed, but quietly said to the nurse; do you make it a habit to check out baby cock much? Then followed by a slight grin, and then a noticeable chuckle on just how inappropriate the whole thing really was. 
They; thank God, missed the reference, but Mechele did not and she just blurted aloud, “What an ass to the nurse!” Years later, I told this story in front of Connor’s friends in California and they all just hooted, “All right dude!” “Haha,” I chuckled, I love embarrassing my not so little boy!!!  
We stayed in Maine at least a year more and then headed down to Orlando to sell our house. We drove down to Orlando via a caravan down route 95 with the three kids, Mechele’s two aunts, and her cousin. When we got there, the prior tenants had destroyed the carpets from a dog one of them kept locked up in the house while they worked. 
The dog peed over and over soaking the rugs right through to the concrete, which once seeped into the slab foundation would stink forever. Other than that, they left the house in good condition with the exception of that situation. 
They had paid rent for nearly a year without ever being late, so I overlooked it when the girl met me, apologized emphatically and said it was her roommate’s dog. I appreciated the fact she came by after they were out and took total responsibility, while she even offered to give me a check for the damage and forego her deposit. 
I was really impressed by her offering to pay for the damages, so I gave her back her deposit and watched her jaw drop and all I said was, “I appreciate you taking responsibility for this and thanks for always being on time with your rent money, so take this and keep it, don’t give any to your roommate.   
First thing I did was tear out all of the wall-to-wall carpeting, swept and thoroughly washed the concrete floor, but I knew the piss had seeped into the concrete and therefor would stink for years to come. 
So, I used a concrete sealant, pouring it all over the floor and used a paint roller to spread it all over, thus sealing any possible odors from ever coming out again from the cured concrete.  
All the repairs were all possible because I took out a second mortgage out on the house and revitalized the whole property, from a new garage door to a beautiful new St. Augustine lawn and gorgeous garden complete with me installing a new automatic underground water sprinkler.  
The interior and exterior got a complete paintjob, including doing the exterior with a rented commercial paint sprayer and I blew it out in four days of ball busting work in plus 90-degree temperatures without slowing down whatsoever, nice to be young still, right?
One afternoon as Connor sat there in our driveway; Mechele began cutting his hair, but remembered she had water boiling on the stove in the house. 
She asked me if I knew how to cut hair and of course I said yes. As I began cutting, I noticed his hair blowing all over the place and I guess I kind of paid too much attention to that when I really should have been paying attention to his haircut.    
My first thought was that I was making good progress when Mechele came back outside. Her jaw dropped wide open as she ripped the scissors out of my hand and screamed, “Oh my god what did you do? He looks like he has some kind of mange or something, WTF!” Oh well, hairstylist I was not! 
Back in Orlando again we lived there almost another year eventually selling the house and moving back home again this time back up to Maine where we had moved into the trailer while we had a home built from a set of plans I made on my computer. 
Before we left Florida for the last time, we did have some fun though. We would often go to Disney theme parks as we bought a family pass that year.  
In Orlando with the three kids one time, we thought that Connor even only just being three years old may have had trouble seeing clearly, so we made an appointment with an optometrist and found that Connor had terrible vision and needed to be fitted with glasses. This Doctor had an accompanying eye glass store, so we immediately bought him a pair of new glasses. 
After eating dinner, it grew dark outside and Connor sat in the back seat of the car and all of a sudden, he blurted out to us, “Oh, that’s what stars look like!” 
Oh god, Mechele and I immediately looked at each other and our jaws dropped at how sad it was, that until the age of three, Connor had never seen stars in the sky until that moment. Kind of tugged at our heart strings just a little bit I would say. 
The year we were there we made friends with more neighbors and Mechele befriended Sherry and Mike. One day before they became friends, Sherry broke the ice as she jogged by our house as we sat there in our driveway. 
She smiled and ran by us and we thought she was a friendly woman. The next day Sherry jogged by us again about the same time and this time she looked stacked in the chest department.  
Mechele punched me in the arm and said, “Oh my God, did she just get a boob job?” We laughed and I said I actually thought she looked hot! About five minutes later she came by, stopped and proclaimed she just got a boob job with a giant smile on her face. I just smirked and said, “They look great!”  
Sherry was married to a cop and had two young girls around our own girls’ age. Sherry and Mechele actually became good friends and hung out a bit.
One day over Sherry’s while Mike had a bunch of cop friends over, we just watched them feast on some fresh jelly donuts and Mackenzie being around four just stared at them as they attacked the fresh donuts. 
Mackenzie always the consummate showman decided she would impart some great wisdom on them and said, “Jelly donuts, white man gotta eat!”  
Just four years old she was something to behold. All the cops just burst out laughing as they heard her goof on them while they were stuffing their cop faces with jelly donuts. 
She apparently quoted Homer Simpson to them and it was really pretty funny when given this exact opportunity that she completely capitalized on, a true Cronin moment!  
During this time, I began drinking occasionally with Mechele for a couple of years lightly. One night however with Mechele and Christina still in town, we went out to a club with our neighbors. 
Mechele was drinking heavily and I followed suit. A bouncer, this wanna be rock and roll poser type with long hair and a beard began pouring shots of tequila to any woman who wanted it.  
I got in line but the bouncer refused me it saying it was only for the ladies. I yelled at him and demanded some free shots, so he poured what I guess must have been close to 5 oz. of straight alcohol down my throat and I was on my way. 
What happened next was eerily reminiscent to my Coast Guard days back on the “Rock” (Governors Island) when I was tabbed. 
When I all of a sudden went into a full-on blackout and I know that if it were just alcohol, I would have been just a little drunk and in much better control, but it so happed that I was in a full-on blackout I can just vaguely remember.  
I strongly suspect that in this bottle of tequila was spiked with the date rape drug called by its street name of Ruffies. I think he regularly made a habit of drugging pretty woman with free spiked shots and probably date raped some of them after the club closed. 
Mechele and I began arguing on the way to the car and I slightly remember as this big guy across the street started yelling at me and asked me if I had a problem.
I remember just barely walking over to him and I was now completely wasted on what I strongly suspect was Ruffies. 
All of a sudden, I got struck on the head by what I was told by witnesses from a ring of keys, or maybe a pair of brass knuckles someone else has suggested, knocking me out cold instantly on the ground.  
Mechele said I had blood pouring from my head wound and nobody could wake me up. Someone called an ambulance and I remember they gave me smelling salts as I came to just briefly as I headed in an ambulance toward the hospital. 
In the hospital they judged me pretty harshly as just another drunk on a typical Saturday night. They did give me the option of having a general surgeon stitch me up on the spot or if I waited until the next morning, I could have a plastic surgeon do it.  
I opted for the plastic surgeon as I now had to lie on an uncomfortable gurney all night long waiting for the plastic surgeon that eventually came in and told me I was smart for waiting for him. 
He did an awesome job I think and I was happy to be finally heading home to recuperate. I was very concussed and it took at least two weeks to feel better again but sported two very black eyes.
I quit drinking for the remainder of our relationship with the exception of a couple of occasional beers; Mechele however, did not. 
This one time as she left me to go to a PTA meeting with her friends, she convinced them to all go out for drinks afterwards.  
I during this time had a prescription of 1mg Ativan’s on my bureau that she got her hands on. I received ten each month for stress but never used them and after a year of saving them, I had close to a hundred in the bottle. 
Within a three-week period of time, she finished the whole bottle without me even knowing about it until this one day. 
After her PTA meeting, she convinced the other moms to go out for drinks and when she returned that evening their PTA after party, she was completely passed out in the back seat of her friend’s car. 
I had to pull her out and carry her back into the house as the three kids curiously witnessed mom’s inebriation and the total loss of control she exhibited.  
Mechele was an alcoholic and had a lifetime of problems with her drinking, however this time I became very concerned when I realized she had been chasing her drinks with tranquilizers and discovered she took over a hundred in under three weeks. What a mess!
Years later as a result of her continued drinking, Connor moved with me when he was about 12 years old. Mechele had a meltdown and in a drunken stupor threatened the kids while telling Mackenzie to go cut her wrists. 
At that point Connor had seen enough and decided to ask me if I’d take him with me to live full-time.  
He also mentioned to me that his mom once harshly complained to him for asking her for money to eat with at 9 pm one night. When I asked if he ate earlier, he said that he had not and that she never usually cooked dinner. 
Nine at night, still had not eaten dinner and she complained when he asked her for $10 to get a sandwich, that was the final straw. Fuck I gave her at one point $2,100 a month for child support, WTF! 
I wrote a letter to the Bridgton District Court where we were divorced detailing many episodes of her drinking and abusing Vicodin and other pain meds. 
I sent it to her directly as well, filed a letter with the clerk magistrate, and received an emergency custody hearing later the next month. I sent a certified letter to Mechele informing her of the hearing and she did not even bother showing up in court. 
Granted full custody, he now lived with me for the next seven years, but I still thought seeing her occasionally some weekends were in his best interest because she still loved him greatly. 
I know this hurt her deeply, but I really was afraid of her alcoholism. Kenzie and Kelsey eventually were asked by me if they wanted to move to Maine with me full-time, but they opted not too, since they had established roots back in Massachusetts. 
But at first, I should have taken Mackenzie with me as her mom was really abusive to her too. I’m sorry Mackenzie, I should have rescued you too right away back then. I thought if I tried taking you too, Mechele would flip out and I was still scared of the courts. 
Mechele dated Richie most of the time up until they parted after a tumultuous last couple of years of dating. It was Mechele’s drinking which was progressively getting worse. 
Richie however kind of did the unthinkable, left Mechele and started dating Mechele’s friend, whom he eventually married after Mechele for years, expected Richie to marry her.  
Once she even told me Richie was her soulmate and was devastated when Richie married her friend. Feeling really betrayed, she turned harder to Vicodin and alcohol that unavoidable killed her. 
Unfortunately, the kids literally watched her die in a terrible devastating death where she cried to the kids she didn’t want to die, but unfortunately years of alcoholism took its toll.   
In Junior High Connor struggled greatly and once a week I went in with him and met with one of his teachers to see that he got extra help from her and ask for tutoring for him too. 
It worked and he graduated into High School after two hard years in there. His teacher warned me however that if he didn’t push himself to do the work in High School that he would meet with failure there. 
High School for Connor was relatively easy or so it appeared. In actuality he did no work and was flunking most of his subjects, except Math, where he did fairly well. By the time he was a junior in High School, he was so far behind that he would probably have to spend another year in High School catching up.  
During High School one time as I was shooting hoops in the yard wasting time until he got home, I witnessed him getting off the short bus and had to take a picture of that to commemorate the occasion. 
Later that night as he slept on the couch, with a permanent magic marker, I drew a unibrow between his eyebrows.  
Feeling like a bad father in-between burst of laughter, I grabbed one of those kitchen sponge scuffies and while he was still sleeping, I began scrubbing his unibrow off with hard amounts of scrubbing when he jumped up and screamed, “what the fuck are you doing,” as he ran to the mirror and said aloud, “you suck I hate you dad, I got school in the morning!”
Other times at Hannaford, Connor would do other stupid things like get me in trouble for buying him cigars! I know, my fault, shouldn’t have done that, but the way I figured it he was mild compared to me when I was his age!
So, Hannaford’s again, this time Connor moves my truck into another parking lot as I finish my shopping and try to find it in the cold winter night-time!
Many times, that year, I went into his school and tried to see if I could get him some help. Nevertheless, the reality was he did not do any of his homework and therefor was flunking most of his subjects. 
I eventually made a move that changed his future for the better. I removed him from the traditional High School and put him in another less challenging High School that better suited him. The main objective for him was to receive his diploma and enter the US Air Force which he actually did do.
The day of graduation he and his cousin were graduating together and Taylor his cousin; my niece had the second highest GPA in that school year. She had also been very involved in the school theatre and actually was the lead performer in most of the High School productions. 
Connor unfortunately had the lowest GPA but did graduate with a diploma. He was able to take the ASVAB military test and scored high enough to get into the Air Force which still made me very proud! 
Connor and I actually got along very well! I did have a slight problem transitioning from part time dad to full time dad. When I had him on the weekends before full custody, I kept the discipline to a limit. 
I was the fun parent! I bought a nice boat with help from my mother and we often went to our favorite beach, Sandy Beach on Sebago Lake in Maine, actually the beach where I met his mom. 
In the early days of shared custody, I designed and built my own home by obtaining financing with the VA. They loved coming to Maine and all three kids came most weekends and stayed long lengths of time during the summer. They considered me the fun dad and they often brought up friends with them too. 
When I had custody of him, I had to transition back into a disciplinarian while maintaining some of the same relationship I had prior to this. Being his friend and dad didn’t always work. We butted heads a couple of times but we always managed to work through it. 
There was one time he threatened to move back with his mom, so I bribed him by buying him an expensive dirt bike which settled him down, a necessary bribe that kept him from uprooting himself again which in my opinion would have been much worse for him to live with an alcoholic mother. Plus, I loved him greatly and didn’t want to lose him again!  
The day I bought his bike must have been in early March. The roads had a little ice still on it and he asked me if he could take it out for a ride with his friend who had his own dirt bike. 
As he left, I reminded him to be careful and to stick to the trails. Fifteen minutes later, I received a phone call from a woman who told me my son was in a motorcycle accident.  
As she began to speak, she started saying, “Mr. Cronin, your son has been in an accident----,” and the line cut out. For fifteen minutes or so, I franticly tried calling back the number on the caller ID, but because Maine was so rural, she didn’t have great service there. 
Fifteen minutes of pure hell went by, when I received another call from this woman’s phone number and I quickly answered it. This time it was Connor and he said he was fine. 
He told me he wiped out and messed up his bike and that I needed to go and pick him and the bike up near where my parent’s mobile home was located across town. 
Very relieved, but somewhat still shaken up, I agreed to go get him and his bike. As I got there, he was still there with the woman and there was Mr. Sweetland too. Mr. Sweetland was Mechele’s x-father-in-law who apparently witnessed speed racer wipeout doing close to 60 MPH.  
I got there, put down the tailgate and had him and his friend push the bike up the ramps I bought for his bike. As he pushed, I heard him complain he was in pain and that his wrist hurt him. 
I jumped out of the truck and helped the boys push it into the truck and drove home with him. Later he showed me his swollen wrist and the next day I took him and got an x-ray at the hospital.  
A week later, he had surgery and had three screws put in his wrist. Connor loved his bike and often would go on rides with his friends. He managed to stay healthy on it and he kept his bike another 3 years, without any further incidents.  
Connor and I use to go into the grocery store together to do our food shopping. I would fill the grocery cart with things we both liked and that I could cook. 
When I left the cart to walk down the aisle, the little bastard use to run off with the cart and hide it down different aisles. He was such a pain in the ass, but I truly loved his character and we had a lot of fun together!  
This one time as we went food shopping in the same store in Bridgton, I left the cart for a brief second and walked in front of it to grab an item off an end cap. As I walked in front of our cart, he tried ramming the cart into my ass. 
But he didn’t think the bottom of the cart would first hit me since the cart first made contact on me on my Achilles heel because of the bottom bar, dropping me instantly in a heap on the floor.  
I screamed at him, swearing loudly while I grabbed my ankle. As I continued screaming at him, dropping f-bombs very loudly, a little kid walked by me with his dad holding his hand and the dad just shot me daggers. I was so pissed at him, but he ran away laughing hysterically out of the store and waited by the car. 
Connor was a good kid who kept out of trouble for the most part. He’s an Irish kid who loves to drink and raise hell like his father did. One day he convinced me to buy him some beer and asked for a case of Buds. I ended up buying him a 12 pack to share with his two friends.  
Not giving it to much more thought I went to bed for the night and began watching TV in my room. What I did not realize is that he found where I hid the last bit of papa’s alcohol, a liter of Jameson Irish Whiskey and he and his friends drank all of it.  
I came down later that night for a snack to first witness Koda throwing up in the downstairs toilet, with his pants pulled down around his ankles, not only that but Tony, his other bud, was upstairs in the same predicament, pants down around his ankles too, throwing up. I am thinking WTF, how can they be so drunk off splitting a 12 pack of beer.  
I checked to see if they were all right, dismissed it and went back upstairs. Checking on them an hour later, Koda apparently filled the toilet bowl with a ton of toilet paper that the dog of ours, Sam had pulled off the spool and ran all over the house with.  
He tried cleaning it all up by flushing all of it at once, flushing the clogged toilet several times over and over, getting toilet water all over the damn place. I screamed WTF and Koda, very shitfaced blurted out something like I was a dick and a bad parent as I moped up toilet water off the floor that he caused.  
I questioned Connor and had no idea he drank papa’s booze. I only found out the night before he left for boot camp when we sat downstairs drinking one last beer together before he went off to boot camp why they were all so drunk that night.
Up in Maine my mother paid for us to go skiing at Shawnee Peak in Bridgeton, Maine. I started off skiing at first but then graduated into buying walkie talkies for the 3 kids and let them ski up the mountain after they all got good at skiing. 
I would remain in communication from ski lodge as I sucked down beers and tried my hand at getting woman’s phone numbers. 
It was fun for all, they got exercise, I got early dinner and a few beers and talked it up with chicks on the mountain, a win-win if you will!
They would report in on the walkie-talkie and tell their locations and I’d ask them to come up to the lodge when they were hungry or needed a hot chocolate! Dad was still fun after all!
They often brought friends up and all were welcome! We’d always have someone’s kid up with me! 
I must say, when they went home the dog and I were very sad to see them go! I didn’t mind the ride to get the kids if it meant being with them, that was never, ever an issue!

There was one time I had the new 2015 Ford Mustang Convertible 412 HP car and I asked Connor if he wanted to try driving it and his eyes lit up like it was the fourth of July. We began driving normally and when we reached the part on 114 where the road got wide, I told him to punch it! 
We must have hit like 120 mph and I could tell he was shitting bricks right about now, so I laughed and told him to ease on the brakes as we slowed down to around 60 mph. Another moment where we bonded for life! 
I love this kid; he is my buddy! He has always taken my back when shit hit the fan!  He’s a real dad’s boy I’ll tell you what!

Connor and I love to bowl and shoot pool! I am better at pool and he is better at bowling. But on any given day we have some of the closest games and he says he’s not very competitive! Ha! I love this kid so much!


Chapter 15: Backstories on Mimi and Papa
 
My dad was the product of a mother who was not nurturing whatsoever and showed no signs of true affection to a child that just needed a normal amount of love, but instead was pushed out the door to school at 4.
My grandmother it turns out was a waspy bitch, whose father was a judge from South Boston, so she acted like she was some type of royalty who couldn’t see to it; that in fact, that caring for someone else’s needs before her own was a foreign concept to her! 
Her complete inability to nurture and validate any type of accomplishment no matter how big or small left a child; with I imagine, with an inferiority complex that must have cut him to his soul.
He persevered however a little broken, but instinctually he was a deeply moral man who knew right from wrong and saw and felt how unjustly he was ignored by both parents who favored Dickey the younger son greatly! Jesus, at one point he was considering even being a priest for heaven’s sake! 
He graduated school early and joined the Navy when he was 17, lying to the draft board in order to do his part in the war effort.
He had aspirations for being a corpsman, but instead got orders to San Diego and was never deployed into battle as it was toward the end of the war!
Early on in this book, I questioned why he acted so crazy and sometimes detached from reality. After talking with my sister Katie, she filled me in on a lot of background information that at the time I was just too young to know about. 
He struggled deeply by the turbulent times he went through, all while dealing with 5 kids and a disabled mother-in-law whom he loved deeply! 
His heroes, like John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and finally Bobby Kennedy were all gunned down and as I said in my author’s notes - our generation developed a more cynical view of the world and life overall! 
Cynical, how about heartbroken! He was particularly hit hard by these assignations and now, still deeply religious himself, would hear priests speak from the pulpit about moral issues like desegregation and their bigotry was apparent as they openly spoke against it in church!
He felt what hypocrites they were and I remember him in church loudly mumbling so, as Mass was going on. He knew just how unfair it was that whites got a much better education that blacks did and the church morally in his opinion should have backed desegregation, but instead showed its bigotry and said so from the pulpit! 
I think when Nana died, it hit him the hardest! My mom’s mother was a true Liberal and dad aligned with her unlike anything he could in his own mother! 
So, Vietnam was happening, after Kennedy in all likelihood; it was found out years later, would probably have gotten us out altogether. 
Nobody can verify this, except a vague conversation I had with him when I was 10 and I never asked anyone to verify it, but both older brothers mysteriously got broken legs at about the time when they were eligible for the draft. 
I’m pretty sure that dad drugged them with pain killers and broke both their legs. He wasn’t going to let that shitty war in Vietnam take his kids away from him. Nope, it wasn’t going to happen!
The bottom line was, the fact was that mom and dad were true Christian people. They if anything were closer in line to Jesus’s teaching than any of these false profit Christians of the time or for that matter of this time too! 
They cared for the poor! Worked to help the poor! Dedicated themselves to teaching their children what they inherently knew was right and we did learn it as our philosophies have stayed true to our parents’ ideals! 
Dad’s destructiveness at this time coincided with all these major events and it was just too much for this man and he broke down. 
His quasi-suicidal behaviors and his extreme loose temper was him falling apart, having a nervous breakdown after breakdown and although he didn’t know it at the time, his actions imprinted on us kids a sense of having no security and for me and a lifelong compulsion to never again trust those I loved the most. 
The ones I loved the most I feared the most and would inevitably hurt me the greatest, so trust has always been one of the major missing virtues that I never acquired in my life, or not until recently!

Life is funny, because sometimes you get a do-over, and for dad he got one! He remarkedly got help and eventually became a beacon of light for me years later when I really needed him! 
Could it all have been different? Could I have had a normal childhood and didn’t go through what I did? Who’s to know, but I know I really loved my dad and my mom too, as she was his rock for all those years and the bond they had between them was something that most people only dream about! 
Here are some light hearted stories that depict mom and dad in a manner we all knew them later in life. Some are just outright hysterical and rereading them only makes me miss them more!
Mimi being as generous as the day is long, gave me the money to build my addition with. This was to be considered as my inheritance and I made a deal with her to take care of her there in the new edition, until she died. 
During those years I used to joke with her that I was her chauffeur and butler, as well because the last day she drove, she almost got killed driving her minivan, and I basically decided from then on, I’d be her de facto limousine driver and drive her everywhere she needed to go. 
One afternoon I made plans to go out on a date later that night and before I left, I drove my car in front of hers to show her the way to her appointment. 
What I wasn’t aware of was, she had fasted that day and did not tell me. So, after I showed her the way, I just left. After her appointment she drove her car 40 mph rear-ending a car at a traffic light breaking her ribs and almost died. I told her after I would drive her anywhere she needed to go, but no more driving for her.
I did love having her there at home and with her generosity, my kids never went without. The kids use to love going into her apartment and Mackenzie always slept on the couch with her, keeping her company as they binged watched the show 24 together. Kenzie especially loved Mimi and still constantly fondly recalls her memories of her. 
I did hurt her feelings one time by complaining her stinky adult diapers smelt like pee. So, she threatened to move to Michael’s house, but when Michael told her she had to get around by taking the bus, she changed her mind pretty fast after I apologized to her.
When I was with my mom, I took her out shopping many times, but she used to get infuriated when I became impatient with her and she would just scream at me. Nevertheless, to my defense, there was one time where she just stared at a head of lettuce for a whole minute once, before she put it back in the lettuce pile. 
Another time while food shopping with her, she decided to drive the damn handicap electric wheelchair, when all of a sudden, she decided to make a quick U-turn driving the damn cart right, stopping it on top of my foot and began laughing at me while I screamed in pain. 
She sat there laughing so hard she cried and I actually had to reach over to the controls and move the 250 lb. wheelchair forward off my foot. 
Not done yet she tried turning her wheelchair around still laughing in the dairy isle, but when she backed up, she cracked one of the freezers all the way up the side of it, rendering it probably unusable.   
This reminds me of another time, when I was driving both my parents to a dentist appointment for my dad. After we went to the dentist, we went to a restaurant I frequented a lot where she bought us a wonderful meal. Papa had to use the bathroom before we left, so I took him in.  
Papa who had his stroke some five years earlier needed help getting his junk out. I was none too happy about pulling his weaner out of his pants but like a good son, I did it. He placed his hands above on top of the urinal and started to go. I took one-step backwards so I wouldn’t get any more back splash on me.  
All of a sudden, he listed to the right and then listed heavily to the right still clutched onto the top of the urinal. Before I knew it, he leaned so hard to the right he actually tore the urinal right off the wall which started flooding the bathroom immediately.  
In a panic I screamed, “Oh my good WTF, you stupid bastard!” as he started moaning, I’m sorry Chrissy, I’m so sorry and I just said aloud sarcastically, “You are sorry alright mister,” as I began to laugh uncontrollable at that point, pulling up his pants with him still peeing now getting a little on my hands.  
We left the bathroom then with the place now flooded with about an inch of water on the floor. Mom had met us at the door and looked at me befuddled and I said let’s get the fuck out of here. She had no clue what was going on but knew that I was just in a big rush to leave.
Dad however had other plans and began to scream, “Miss, Miss, I accidentally pulled the urinal off the wall.” I was like; “Dad just shut the Christ up and let’s go!” We left the place in a hurry with me not daring to look back. Needless to say, I never frequented the restaurant after that scene ever again!  
This left me with one hell of a funny story I must have retold a hundred times. It was so damn funny though, the way he was so determined to call the waitress over and explain his huge mishap. I really loved my dad and every day I think of him and realize that he is still here constantly watching out over me.  
I loved my mother as well and we were really close too, so I use to tell her all the stories I have written in this book while I had her in my car. She would scream and say, “Goddamn it Chrissy, I’m like a fucking prisoner stuck in this damn car with you, and you’re torturing me with all of your goddamn stories, please shut the fuck up!” 
I got a kick at how I had her just saying, “Please just shut the fuck up, you’re driving me fucking crazy, and you’re such a bad kid!”  
My mom had an operation on her neck to stop a nerve from being pinched which was very debilitating. Therefore, this involved about six trips from our house in Maine to the Lahey Clinic in Massachusetts which was a 250-mile roundtrip.  
I always made myself available to take her to her appointments back in Portland as well as the ones in Massachusetts. This one trip on the way back from our trip to Mass she bought lunch and then we stopped for gas. 
It was your normal gas station with a store attached that sold you the regular items. I remember my mom giving me her pocketbook as I went into the station to prepay for gas since the pump wasn’t working properly. 
I stood in line and approached the teller when unbeknownst to me, she decided to get out of the car and attempt to walk into the store to tell me to buy a candy bar.  
As this was happening, I reached the counter with the teller patiently waiting for me to pay and I began pulling out items out of her pocketbook looking for her wallet. 
I pulled out an orange, a package of Twinkies, but still could not see her wallet. I dug deeper, then pulled out what I thought was a handkerchief put it on the counter where all of her items began piling up when I realized they were a spare set of underwear she kept with her since she was incontinent and sometimes needed a spare.   
The exact moment I placed her underwear on the counter, I laughed aloud and said, “Oh my god, what else does this goddamn woman have in here? Looking out the storefront window that same exact second, we all witnessed her pants dropping to her ankles. 
Now bare-assed and in front of everyone in the store, I laughed so hard I almost pissed my own pants. I was not the only one laughing too; the clerk and people in line all were chuckling hard as I finally reached her wallet and paid for it using her credit card. 
Poor Mimi was so embarrassed when I got back in the car with her as she cried a little as we drove off. I for an hour felt horrible until we finally talked about it and we both laughed hysterically about 20 minutes later. 
She was such a good person, I loved her very much and when I was growing up, I am sure it was her that pushed my dad into driving to New York to see I was out of trouble. She had her hands in much of what happened that was positive in my life! 
About a month after Mimi died Michael planned a memorial dinner which was held at a restaurant near Scituate Beach Lighthouse where Mimi and Papa first met. 
I drove down with the kids and it was a particularly beautiful clear sunny blue day. As we approached the restaurant, there was an extraordinary cloud that descended out of a very clear sky that covered the restaurant in a strange and supernatural way.  
When Papa died years earlier, the kids were all young and they did not truly understand what happened. Papa died in Scituate while chocking on a slice of pizza while eating in bed and Mimi was unable to revive him and frantically knocked on neighbors’ doors trying to find someone to help her, but unfortunately, they were too late. 
Poor Mimi watched her husband of 57 years take his last breath and she was truly devastated. During Papas wake I came early with the kids and let them see Papa in his casket. 
They were at first a little nervous as they saw him lying there, but I explained to them that death was just a part of life and that we would all see him again one day. They all respectfully gave Papa a kiss goodbye and that they loved him.  
I heard from some recently that I should not have let the children view papa, but as I think back even today, I gave them the opportunity to say goodbye to him in their own way without others around to cast judgement on my methods. 
I explained to them although his body had passed, that his spirit was always going to be with us watching out for us. Kind of like our own loving angel!  
My kids never had any fear nor had any nightmares associated with the funeral. They got to say goodbye to him and I asked Kenzie how she felt recently about it and she said I am so glad we all got to give him a kiss goodbye!  
Mimi and Michael spoke to each other about whether there was life after death and they both agreed to one another that in the event of one of them dying first, the other would somehow show a sign that there was a spirit life afterwards. 
I think that the unusual cloud formation for no other plausible explanation, was Mimi, coming over us in the form of a slight misty cloud that was exquisite to show Michael a sign that she was there and that there was life afterwards! 
Michael thought about what had happened, smiled and said that it would be just like her to appear that one last time to us as proof she was still there watching over all of us. 
Mom, I will always love you and will see you again someday hopefully not too soon though!                        

Unfortunately, Michael also died during this period. We had a fitting tribute for him up the Arboretum in Roslindale, where we were all raised and had many connections too. 
I loved Mike and miss him so much and wished I went down that day to rescue him again, but instead tried to rescue my failing marriage instead, which ironically in actuality ended the night Michael died. I hope Mike has peace now and also hope to see him again someday!


Chapter 16: The End of Maine Days
 
From 2001-2014 we lived in my home in Naples Maine that I designed and built myself. It truly was a home for all of us.  Mimi also called this home right up until she passed away in 2007. 
There were many meals shared between my kids, mom and me here, some of which we shared with the many friends they invited over all those years as well.  
The home had a bunch of people who affected my life from my mom, my kids, Anne, Hannah and Sean. Unfortunately, my second wife and her kids came and pretty much just took over, making my house seem as if my kids were not welcome by Julie and her minions.  
Anne was a truly decent woman whom I admired for her charm and honesty. I loved Anne because she never lied, never had a hidden agenda and never pretended to be anything she was not. My kids viewed her as having another fun mom who they could hang out with as she always enjoyed their company and they truly loved hers too.
When we vacationed in Hawaii the two times, I realized her moving there with me would not be good for her. If she moved here, I know she would have missed her kids way too much and I wasn’t going to be the one to take her away from her kids. 
I’m sorry that I didn’t love her the way she so deserved to be loved, I hope in my heart that she finds someone who will love her completely!  
Sean and Hanna were great kids who I enjoyed very much. I am also sorry for leaving them the way I did; they were unfairly blamed for me wanting to leave Anne. They in fact were a great part of our relationship and my kids still think of them as family, as well as Anne. 
Many fun times stand out in my mind, such as the time we went to the 911 movie and during a scene in it, during a part where there was dead silence throughout the movie theatre, I let out a noticeable sob that caught the attention of all the kids and everyone in the damn theatre. They all giggled at me and had many laughs about it into the future.  
They even threatened to create a blog on Facebook called, “When dad cries!” They say they want to fill it all the times I got over-emotional, like when I watched my favorite Tom Hanks movie “Forest Gump” or something else that often choked me up. 
Who would forget when I tried getting an English muffin out of the toaster with a fork? I put the fork into the toaster while it was still on to get the stuck English muffin free and to stop it from burning. Well of course I electrocuted myself, screamed loudly, and calmly reported after, “Toasters broke!”  
Plenty of times we had the snake tube and spent hours boating on Sebago with everyone getting whiplashed. 
Our pontoon boat was a highlight to living on the lake as it provided so much family fun. Sandy Beach in particular was so significant in my life, as I met Mechele there and played in the sands since I was seven. 
Some of both my mom’s and dad’s ashes were both scattered there helping one of the bushes to bloom the next year they were placed there. Circle of life?!? 

During my long run of dating Lisa’s, I eventually settled down with Anne and her kids. They provided lots of love and comfort to my mom who shared living there with all of them. I did love her kids and I hope they can forgive me for my abrupt departure in their lives.

Julie Days
My relationship with Julie kind of sucked. I felt I got used by her and her whole family and I always paid for everything when I was with that bunch. Julie and I divorced and she left for Florida with her two daughters. I do consider our marriage a total waste of time.   
They all used my VA benefits getting a $1,000 stipend each month while they attended school. Even Julie completed hairdressing school finally after three previous attempts. After we broke up, I let her and her entire family live there while she finished school which took a whole two months after we broke-up. 
She was not very nice to my kids either, where I did so much for hers. Those years would have been better spent if I never got involved with her and had my kids still coming up to Maine. 
They avoided coming up since Julie’s family viewed them as an inconvenience. If I had it to do all over, I would have taken a pass on the whole Julie thing!
Toward the end after her son had moved in with his wife and child after Julie promised they would never do that; he eventually left my mom’s apartment upstairs where he abandoned his six-month pregnant wife for some white chick he got involved with.  
My fear was Julie may have tried to prolong her stay in my house, which would have screwed up my move to Hawaii. She demanded $5,000 which I gave her and she did leave eventually after I let her stay in my home so she could finish hairdressing school.  
Julie’s daughter in-law who I actually liked was still in the apartment with her son after the whole crew had left. Julie had just left with her two daughters leaving this poor woman stranded in my mom’s apartment by herself without any type of support from either Julie or her son.   
Eventually Julie’s daughter in-laws farther drove up from Louisiana to bring her back. I felt so bad for her with her being now seven months pregnant and not having any substantial support from her dead-beat husband or from her mother in-law either, Pretty Scummy!  
Divorced and a free again!
Nearing the end of my stay in Maine and before I could officially get up and go, I first had to make sure Connor was going to finish basic training in the Air Force. In addition, I had accumulated 15 years’ worth of stuff along with my mother’s stuff as well. I sold everything I owned except my Mustang on Craigslist.  
Connor was leaving for basic training in the US Air Force and before he left, we were going to throw him a party. Since he was missing Thanksgivings at my house, we all decided to throw him what we coined as “Connergiving’s.”   
Mechele drove up to say her goodbyes and cook a turkey for what she thought would be for twelve people. When 50 showed up she forfeited her own dinner to feed someone else. 
Connor said he would do the same thing but I didn’t let him and told him to eat one more dinner with his family all together.  
The night started out okay but after a while fifty or so people had arrived so I was just a little nervous of the cops. The next night however with Connor with him and his last night, he had a couple of friends over, and Connor and I drank beer together in the basement as we played beer pong together.  
He told me all of the crap he pulled as a kid, stuff I had no idea about. He volunteered this to me, since he was going into boot camp the next day. Overall, not too bad though, he was a great kid! Aletta and I saw him off and I focused on selling off the rest of my things.  
The girls had one more outing with friends and we all said goodbye to our home of 14 years. I left the house January 5th in immaculate shape and left, got Kenzie and Matt in Boston, drove to Texas and flew down Kelsey and Aletta to see Connor graduate boot camp. 
On January 4th we had an ice storm which covered everything in a sheet of ice. The next day, January 5th when I left my home for the last time, I looked back and thought to myself about all the sweet memories I would be leaving behind in its wake.   
As I got onto the Maine turnpike heading to Boston, an eighteen-wheeler got onto an on-ramp in front of me and that day where we were actually in a wind storm and the damn wind blew hard blowing all the ice of the tractor trailers roof landing it onto my hood of my Mustang. Luckily my windshield didn’t crack but left a few chips in the paint on the hood of my car.
On the drive across the country and before we got to San Antonio, we visited Kenzie’s and Matts friend’s grave which was really awesome. Matt placed a pack of Marlboro Reds and Kenzie put a few packs of ketchup on Vinnie’s grave in a sad but touching tribute to him. 
 During the trip across the country and as we drove into San Antonio the first night, we approached San Antonio via a route that was under construction. We drove into a very dense traffic situation where we all were driving with the flow of traffic which was over 70 mph. 
As we went around this very dangerous corner, our exit appeared quickly on the right and I had to negotiate three lanes of traffic getting all the way over in extreme heavy moving traffic very fast so I wouldn’t miss my exit.  
We saw the off ramp on our right when it was almost too late. I said aloud I am going for it, as Mackenzie screamed no! That second when I needed the right side-mirror, Matt decided he was going to lean forward and stick his head right in front of my view of the mirror which blocked all the oncoming traffic behind us. 
Asking if the coast was clear, but not hearing Matt’s voice because he mumbled, I blindly drove over to the adjoining highway. I drove over the lines as I hit the gas so we would not get rear-ended and my angel saved us again, Thank God!   
After Connor’s graduation ceremony, we all said our goodbyes and we left Texas and headed to California to ship the Mustang to Hawaii. I was so proud to see him graduating and still remember clearly how happy it made me feel, to see him as a successful young man from the cool kid he was, to the grown-up mature guy he had become. 
We saw my niece Johana in Oakland the night before I flew Matt and Kenzie over to Hawaii with me. I had already given a deposit for an apartment in the exact same building I lived back in 1990 with their mom.  
	

Chapter 17: Back in Hawaii
 
Getting back to Hawaii the first week with Kenzie and Matt was fun. After we cleaned the apartment, I showed them the island in our rental car. They discovered Sandy Beach with me and I carefully instructed them of the shore break, and they heeded my warning and swam out about sixty feet out to avoid the pounding shore-break. 
I sat and watched them as they playfully dove through the heavy surf and we later headed up to the North Shore. It was hard to see them go when they left the island as I knew I wouldn’t see them for quite a while, but we still all had so much fun while we were there altogether. 
Dating in Hawaii again was bizarre at first, as I met some crazies that first eight months or so. I dated a Filipina woman for a few months, but after her son told me he was going to fuck my shit up, I opted to break up with her. 
Not fearing for myself, I actually was   nervous that her son might mess with my Mustang and I was not having any of that! 
I remember dating a woman who was involved with an x-cop who was a heavy steroid abuser and yes, he was large, gun carrying and crazy. She explained to me that she was his life-slave and that if I wanted; I could take over the role of being her master, “Fucking strange right?” 
It gets better! She tells me one night that after she was back again with him one day and while they drove past my apartment building, he had mentioned he thought she was screwing someone in my building.  Yah it was good old me!
He said if he found out he would kill the guy and kill her afterwards. She explained all of this as I smoked some strong Hawaiian weed with her, which after that night I decided to quit any future smoking because of how paranoid I had now become.
There was even a woman who suggested I could pay to sleep with her supporting her kids. This meant buying them food, helping with rent and God knows what else she had in mind.  
I would have none of that, because I never-ever would pay for anybody’s company and on top of that, I definitely could have done and did actually do better on my own without having to pay for it, a Capitalist, I guess!
Others seemed as though they wanted a real commitment before we did the deed. They were from the old school that shunned sex and lived by the motto sighting the saying “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free,” thus never having sex before a commitment was rendered. 
Color me stupid, but sex always happens first in my world to see if there’s good sexual chemistry between someone I picked as a potential girlfriend, if not, why bother! 
I lived in my old apartment that once lived in way back in 1990-1992. Life had gone around full-circle again, as I was back there where my Hawaiian life all started so long, long ago.  

Some of the beautiful woman I’ve been with would blow your minds. But after living in Hawaii again for like seven years I know I have to move home again to be with my kids. I made a point of coming home a few months a year to see my girls and have been helping out wherever I can! 
So, in 2023 I sold my condo and went to live near Travis Air Force Base in California. I lived in Vacaville, Ca. where I saw my grandkids regularly and Connor and I would bowl together, as he told me I’d like it, even though I was skeptical!
2 years I lived In Cali and decided it was time to go home and buy property, which eventually I did! My life goals shifted back to my children and continue with my grandchildren and soon, I will position myself to live with family up until I die. Hopefully I can leave them something I accumulated in my last quarter of life!

Before I left Hawaii, I witnessed the impossible one night, as the Patriots came back from being blown out, down 25 points, in what turned out to be the biggest Super-Bowl comeback ever. That was wicked cool! 
                                    
A year later I sat there on the eve of another Patriot Super-Bowl, Go Pats! Okay, lost that one, but a year later we won again in 2018-2019 season. Brady to date had 6 rings and counting, go Pat’s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
               
                                     
  A month before this we saw the largest moon in over 40 years be swallowed by a dinosaur cloud. Hawaii is so magical and I am so fortunate to have been able to have lived there. 
Being with Ronnie had been both really a joy and a challenge but I had also found her to be a genuine true friend that I’ll always love and cherish. I wrote a tribute poem to her that describes just how I feel, I hope you’ll enjoy it! 
	
Soulmate Friend

Soulmate Friend                                                                           Ronnie’s weak and must go to bed!                                                                          She says she must rest her tired sleepy head!           Because she needs to rest her weary mind                                                                   and leave this troubled world so far behind.
Now alone she drifts off to sleep                                                                          and thinks how this day has been so complete.    	She knows her true love is not so far away               and she will be with him again soon someday.
        With that knowledge now in her head,		 she drifts off quietly in her bed.
Sleep well my dear Ronnie girl sleep well.                                                              Being away from you has been such hell!
The torment I go through because we are so far apart, really tears away at my lonely heart!
I know this will all end soon some sunny day 	and everything will be okay.			 We were meant to be together until the end, because you are so much my soulmate friend!
As we hurdle through space and time,                                                                    as I hold your Heart and you hold Mine,                                  I realize that a love like ours has no end,                                                                      since you truly are my one and only Soulmate Friend!

While in Hawaii it turned out my x-wife Mechele had succumbed to her alcoholism and 3 months of on and off hospitalization, she was admitted to the hospital one last time where my girls watched helplessly as their mom’s liver failed and caused Mechele to spew blood from her nose and mouth as she emphatically gasped that she didn’t want to die.   
Mackenzie the nurse was put with the task of deciding and convincing her siblings to sign a DNR as she knew her mom’s quality of life was nonexistent.  
What they witnessed was horrific and the girls were horrified as Mechele basically chocked on her own blood. Kelsey called me in a frantic state of mind telling me in detail how she died. I knew immediately I had to fly home to Boston to console my girls and attend Mechele’s funeral.  
I even tried to get the Coast Guard to give me a hardship grant of $3,000 which I would have donated to Mechele’s burial expenses and help with my airfare but a miscommunication happened between me and the Coast Guard and basically, I was denied, “Semper Peratus” my ass! 
In my life, my colon surgery seemed to have stopped my bad diverticulitis as I am feeling better every day and years after I had nine inches of my colon taken out to stop this disease, I am still doing well. 
I had been successfully working out again, doing pushups and hiking 5-6 miles. So, life goes on and I intend to be around until my 90’s as a gypsy once forecasted, that would be cool huh!? 
On the day 09/24/2017 I managed to do 7 sets of 75 pushups for a total of 525 pushups in a three-hour period while watching the Pats play on TV.  That was in the past as father time has finally caught up to me. We all slow down at some point, don’t we?
Okay so in the past, when living here before, I did this feat in 35 minutes, but that is when I was 30, not 58 when I did it again.   
Fast forward 3 years and I’m 61. Still was walking and doing pushups but covid-19 has struck society and as a result even I had begun over isolating to avoid contracting this illness. 
A few years ago, I did get a virus that did scar my lungs and now I have asthma. So covid-19 stay away please!  
As a matter of fact, in July around my birthday I caught covid myself, but because I had all 4 shots of vaccinations it hadn’t affected me at all, thanks science! Later on, I caught the flew and that was bad however! My son had to bring me to the emergency room for breathing treatments since I already have COPD.

	Connor getting married was a blessing as his new beautiful wife Roslyn gave me my first granddaughter and grandson and I am officially Papa thanks to Rory and Finn Cronin! 
Going back to Hawaii the second time was the time of my life! I enjoyed it so much the second time around with going to Waimanalo Beach and Bellows AFB Beach, probable the best beaches I’ve ever been to in my life.

Makapu’u Point and in the next picture is the Baby Makapu’u beach! 

Leave the parking lot at Makapu’u Lighthouse parking lot and take a right and drive less than a ½ mile.
  
You’ll see the entrance to this beach on the right, drive in and park. Oh yah, you can either Uber it, or rent a car!  Connor was supposed to scatter some of my ashes here, but a break-up with Ronnie meant ashes would be scattered on Sandy Beach in Maine!   
Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii 

   Bellows Beach, Hawaii My favorite place!                                                                  My favorite beach in the world
Sunset Beach, North Shore, Oahu, Hawaii, prettiest place on earth!

Kelsey gets me better than almost anyone and when I need to talk to someone, I’ll go call her up first. 
I know her life has been hard recently, so I have delighted her with my misfortunes which oddly enough makes her laugh out-loud… Kido I love You and I love each one of you sooooo much.  
I stayed with Kelsey and helped to redo her place a little at a time. Kyle and Kelsey were gracious enough to let me live with them for six months and during this time they had their marriage celebration the way they wanted between them, but I want to do more! 
But seeing Mackenzie was the highlight of my summer as her and Matt got married that year in August!


Chapter 18: The move to California to be with Connor, Roz, Rory and Finn

Moving to Honolulu and saying goodbye to Ronnie was tough. Selling my property and ending the 7 years I spent in Hawaii plus the 3 in the 90’s is going to hard to live without. Ronnie and I have spent 7 months talking on the phone 3 times a day when I moved here in California, so saying goodbye to her was really hard to do. 
Connor has been great and stepped in because my finances in Hawaii were left in somewhat of a mess, plus I had cosigned a note with my son-in-law and I was not able to secure a good interest rate at the Kia dealership in California that Connor was able to do for me! 
I wanted the Kia since gas prices shot up to $7 a gallon and the Kia got up to 48 MPG on the highway, plus KIA was a really well-made car too. 
So, at the dealership he volunteered to take the loan and we got a good rate as I dropped 10K on it to lower the monthly payment. Love that boy, he is definitely my buddy!  Someday, I hope to make it up to him in spades!
Getting a little R & R
Rory is in good hands with mom there, as Roz is really such a great mom. I know Rory will always love her mom because she has shown true love to both her kids and it really shows! They look completely loved!
Three Generations of Cronin’s at Home Depot
It wasn’t long ago when I cosigned a note for his Jeep too. But he’s my kid so I owe him big-time! The future depends on how long he stays in. I’ll go where he does. When he heads east, I’ll follow him to Maine or New Hampshire and we talked about getting land together and building or buying something pre-made.  
It’s been a tumultuous week as I went to Napa Valley to try out an Italian restaurant to only have a detour happen on the way home while my GPS shut-off leaving me in uncharted waters. So, dusk came I’m driving without detour signs looking for I-80 and someone cuts me off as I approached a stop sign which I blow through accidently. 
Wouldn’t you know it, the first time I had a glass of wine in almost 2 years was tonight too. So, the cop gave me a ticket for the sign and I didn’t get noticed for the 1 drink I had thank God! 
But the next day, I self-tested myself for covide where I did test positive. I knew the day before I felt off! I am riding it out so far with mild flu-like symptoms. 
Maybe my luck will change as I am playing 15 lottery tickets in tomorrow’s 1.2 billion dollar drawing tomorrow evening. I imagine the payout would be like $750,000,000. Phew, what on God’s earth could I do with that?
Connor has always been a real loyal friend to me! I remember having a blowout fight with my second wife and I called her the “C” word and she called the police on me and basically made up some shit that I threated her somehow. A lie by the way!
So, I left and drove to Bridgton and found out where Connor was hanging and I told him my situation and went on to tell him I needed him to come home to back up my side of the events, which were actually the truth mind you!
I immediately thought he’d say no way, I’m with my friends right now! But no, he said OK dad lets go! 
We got in drove home and the police told Julie to leave since I wasn’t there for them to talk to me! Connor saved the day my devoted pal! I love you boy!!!
Getting to hang out with Connor again has been amazing, playing pool and now bowling, I’m truly loving it. I love this kid so much it’s ridiculous! Roz is sweet too and getting to know her better has been awesome too. 
My grandkids are so much fun, they shower me with love and I am so glad I left Hawaii to get to see them grow up. My plans are to stay with Connor here and when he moves back to the east coast follow him then, kind of playing that one by ear. 

Rory and Finn have been a blast from the start! They have warmed up to me immediately and I love them so much, they are my little buds!

Chapter 19: A Therapeutic Epiphany 
 I did not know it at the time, but dad’s suicide attempts in front of us when I was young would have a deep impact on my close relationships throughout my entire life. I developed a fear of intimacy with loved ones, especially romantic relationships throughout my entire life’s journey.  
I especially noticed this when I got older and had to simultaneously deal with the onslaught of the symptoms of having a combination of schizophrenia, while also having symptoms of being bi-polar as well, which definitely magnified my fear of intimacy.  
 What I unconsciously absorbed by my dad’s antics was that if I got into a close relationship, I might somehow fear it ending somehow horribly. I obsessed over infidelity often; thinking woman I was involved with would inevitably hurt me and the relationship would end. 
Being in love with someone and still showing this emotion to them, while still having paranoid ideations about these fears would often cause me to revert to sabotaging my relationships by aggressively acting out, spying on them, always trying to prove or disprove their suspected infidelity.  
I typically searched for some kind of evidence of their screw-ups; always waiting and believing someone close to me would inevitably fail me as had happened when I was little. 
Not fully understanding that dichotomy, they would often abandon me, giving up on our relationship. This too often became a self-fulfilling prophecy, where intimacy would often lead to eventual emotional instability and more failed relationships. 
People with schizoaffective disorders often do give up due to their own unimaginable frustration with life’s conditions caused by this disease, as some had it brought about by trauma, while others inherit it through parents own traits given to their unsuspecting offspring.   
My trauma inflicted on me at the Coast Guard bases enlisted man’s club on Governor’s Island that night back in 1981 was something of a horror show. 
Getting invited to a party by someone who didn’t like me should have set off alarm bells, but I went anyways. 
Pollo Pinardi, this loser E-1 whom I had an incident with 2 weeks earlier was pouring me drinks as the makeshift bartender. He tabbed me with over 30 hits of LSD and some quaaludes too!
As I began tripping his friend attacked me and I became vicious and fought four guys at once!
My buddy was upstairs in the other bar and they descended down with 10 other guys and we rioted. 
I won’t rehash the whole fight again, but that night and being tabbed with all that LSD really messed up my cognitive ability to make sense out of trust situations and I became forever conditioned never to trust again!
Having both auditory and visual hallucinations the rest of my life was just part of the damage that night did to me! 
Those who have been subjected to such a violent life altering event take two paths! Some commit suicide while others exhibit bouts of heavy drinking and doing drugs to self-medicate and kill pain as I had done years after this event which left me never living up to my fullest potential. Some people however reach a point in their life where they just give up and find a way to die!
I fought to keep my sanity! I 20-30 different prescriptions to find anything that would make me feel normal again! 
Nothing worked for over 20 years as the doctor’s had me misdiagnosed as a manic depressive.  Wrong drugs were administered and I suffered woefully! 
Finally, when I lived in Hawaii the second time, I received the right drugs and I realized peace for the first time in 30 years! 
Invega Sustena was introduced to me around 2020 on Oahu by a Psychiatrist who would quit and become an author writing children’s books! Boy did he know symptomology! 
My struggles while I was in the Coast Guard back in 1981, left me permanently scarred as well as some life altering events prior to being in the service! 
I loved my dad so much! Nevertheless, when he pulled that crap on us when I was so young, he couldn’t have ever imagined just how much of a negative impact it would carry in all of our lives within our own personal relationships.  
Living with my past, still doggedly haunting my present, paranoia entwined itself into my thinking becoming hard wired and set up now as a definite learned behavioral pattern.  
Later in life during the many therapy sessions I had attended, I discovered this strange dynamic in relationships where I developed a great fear of intimacy with anybody that I loved all the while projecting the worst possible outcome I predictably brought about. 
Seeing a therapist recently she gave me some true insight as how to handle the present. Her advice came after acknowledging that I did indeed live through 3-4 traumatic events in adolescence and in my early adulthood. 
In her opinion I could have been totally defeated, as many people like me had been and driven to give up. 
However, given the gift of being a fighter, I never gave up! I knew inherently life was meant to be lived to the fullest, trying to give and receive love without fear and to be kind and compassionate toward everyone who has touched me in my life.  
My latest therapist; through her advice, brought me full circle from helping me understand the trauma I lived through, to making me understand that I was not to live life as, “Just a survivor” anymore!
She went on to explain, “That being a survivor meant that someone who has been designated either by themselves or by a professional as a survivor, meant they could and would never overcome the devastation visited upon them.” 
She explained that constantly living with the label and mindset of being a survivor would trap them to constantly relive the trauma and therefor still act symptomatically as a hurt and weakened person. 
What she suggested was for me to view myself as someone who was healed, not someone who was still just surviving the past traumatic events.  
Considering oneself as a survivor just validates that they are still damaged. This consequentially causes one to accept their condition without ever realizing the option to heal the unhealthy state of mind, which in my case was a pattern I held onto of constantly battling my fear of my partners imagined infidelity. 
Part of the problem she suggested is from traumatic events which happened when I was young that were never adequately placed in long term memory thus still maintaining itself as a fresh memory of trauma that gets mixed up in my current thinking patterns in with my short memory patterns. 
She explained that there is a five-step trauma therapy that can place the traumatic events into long term memory, thus preventing it from resurfacing in my current thought patterns. 
These thought patterns which are so deeply imbedded in my brain have been imbedded or hardwired through years of negative repetition and must take constant attentiveness at replacing negativity, with positivity. 
She optimistically guaranteed however that with sufficient amount of practice I could overcome the negative thought patterns I have that are so deeply imbedded in me, and meditate toward happier thought patterns! 
Currently and in the future the negative ideations that I sometimes project will constantly have to be kept in check, replaced immediately with practicing living in the moment with a more optimistic view of the people and world around me.     
Immediately replacing all negative thoughts with a healthier positive view is imperative. It does give me a better grasp on how to positively interpret any given situation or event in an optimistic light. This will lead inevitable to a feeling that things are fine and over time can become the new relearned thought pattern.  
This process is a reconditioning process basically rewiring all of my cognitive thinking skills, forcing myself to view life in an optimistic way and I will continuously try to envision a more serene perspective with more positive outcomes. 
I can no longer allow negative thoughts of fear to control my sanity, mood, or rob my drive of attaining a more satisfying and fulfilling life or ever wallow in the mire of being a recovering victim.  
I must replace recovering with being fully recovered. No longer is there an excuse for playing the victim card and allowing myself to act as if I were still damaged.  
Knowing what I know now, there is no longer an excuse for me to live life as if I am emotionally disabled. I am now working on rewiring my brain with a more positive potential for seeing things in the here and now which while currently writing this down here in my autobiography I can clearly see the whole rationale behind it.  
Training myself to live in the here and now will be freeing without having negative projections of doubt and insecurity. I can no longer pretend to know what the future will bring using negative paranoid predictions based on past experiences! Hence, think positively and take one day at a time living in the moment! 
As new circuitry is constructed over time. I can confidently work better with it, while the old negative patterns will have been discarded and replaced with new ones. 
Trust use to be something someone always had to prove to me and to be earned through constantly having to pass my rigid tests! What I learned from my past is that if I loved someone, I now had to fear them somehow, but that is all in the past!  
Today I view life as a gift! My fear of intimacy does not seem to drive me nearly as much as it used to. Living in Honolulu was amazing as I felt so lucky to have lived there! I am no longer as obsessed with infidelity as I was in my past. It is really freeing to rid myself of such negative energy dragging myself down.  
To proclaim I am totally healed at this point is a stretch. I still have tons of fear in questioning people’s motives and fear of relapsing into old behavior patterns when; for instance, that in a relationship of a potential girlfriend, they would fool around on me, leading to a break up with them for fear of her suspected infidelity. 
But actually, rethinking this currently, I think I probably will handle this 100 times better than before! The new drug from my VA doctors I’m on has all but cured my paranoia and I feel as though I am not plagued with this impediment anymore.
Bernie Strand a therapist in Waimanalo, Hawaii explained every bit of wisdom I learned above and I did comprehend it and am able to put it into practice. 
The brain through years of living out being a victim has not only physically but mentally hardwired itself to reproduce this negative thinking pattern. That rewiring my brain meant that I had to combat paranoid ideations by understanding why I still constantly get flooded with them, replacing them with good thoughts.

Dad and I sitting together in the early 80’s, with me on heavy meds! 
Dad was not a monster! In fact; he later became my hero! However, as I went through my life, he did at times in my life become unpredictably dangerous when I was young.                                                       	  
Horrible events that happened to me while I was in the service were all out of my control, which just further justified and reinforced the fact that I did not have much faith in mankind.  
I had been stuck for years in a maze of confusion which led me in many failed relationships, some regrettably. I however had the foresight to reach out for help and fundamentally did eventually change my mindset.   
I sought out help that was offered to me at every turn. I often wonder if I have had an angel guiding my every move, while conversely thinking at times that in the realm of the whole universe, if instead, I am just really still very insignificant!  
For me right now, I tend to believe the former. There is some kind of force propelling me upward and onward furthering the develop of my cognitive abilities to grasp and comprehend how I should live my life peacefully in the here and now!  
I have completed the next goal in life and moved home and help my kids whenever I can! Being so far away in Hawaii made me realize how much I missed them, so I had decided to move first from Hawaii to California to be with my son and my grandkids. Then back east to home from California early in 2024. 
	My new home I purchased in Claremont, NH. The place feels like home and I now find myself single again and hopefully will meet someone nice. 
	Falling in love again doesn’t seem as scary as it used to be! So, if you’re out there, can’t wait for it to happen again!
Not only did I take a journey in writing this book, but at the same time I wrote and published second book on Amazon titled, “Is the Sun Setting on Our Democracy.” 
Today in writing another book called the Trump Cult “which will also be on Amazon, I have pointed out how crooked and corrupt the Trump administration was, with their right-wing policies and of their continued entrenchment of power which tried to ensure a white nationalistic power base to support the oligarchy into the next generation. 
Trump race baited many of the uneducated poor middle-class folks into believing that voting for him would somehow make life better for them, when in fact, most of his policies were geared at helping the extremely rich business owners, CEO’s and other rich-fat-cat billionaires by trickledown economic tax cuts as middleclass programs were shelved to pay for them. 
Who were most affected? The majority were and still are those that live in the southern states and regularly vote Republican! Do you think they understand? NO!
Some people that have been duped by this con man will eventually figure out just how evil and corrupt this man really was, I hope!


Chapter 20: We Can Make Positive Changes 
Being sensitive to my own plights in life I often reflected on just how unfair life was for the many. I developed a strong consciousness within me that tends to always want to pull for the underdog. 
As I wrote this book, I developed cognitively in areas of reason on how I got to where I am now and why I did the things I did and recognized that people, myself included sometimes acted destructively, while unable to right the ship.  
Wanting a more secure and meaningful life I was led to undertaking the task of learning how everything has shaped me, both the positive aspects as well as the negative. 
After having evaluated past relationships, I did figure out more lately how I could apply good thought processes I have recently developed while simultaneously reprogramming my thought patterns to think more optimistically and expect good things from those I currently am involved with.  
Losing the life-long pattern of assuming the bad in people will constantly have to be practiced by reinforcing new positive thought patterns, as I attempt to develop and replace the old by constantly having to re-ingrain optimism!    
A therapist explained that the brain through negative conditioning has mentally caused me to repeat negativity over and over. 
In my case the negativity I exhibited was from paranoid ideations as well as negative experiences in life that made me suspect my partners infidelities. By establishing these paranoid thought patterns, I always projected the worse outcomes.  
Never being able to alleviate the constant fear of my partners’ suspected infidelity caused me to hard wire these powerful negative emotions and irrational thoughts so I couldn’t ever see just how irrational they really were.  
The therapist convinced me that replacing fearful negative thoughts immediately with more positive ones, could overtime re-establish chemically in my brain, the neurons and neurotransmitters to fire correctly, creating a chemical balance of positive thoughts and actions in myself.  
Today, I generally am able to live a balanced life, although I must rely on psychiatric medications to assist me in keeping a good psychological balance.  The ride I took in the past by having incorrect medications ordered to me by well-meaning psychiatrist at times made me live as though I was in hell!
I persevered and continue to be a good father and now grandfather and hope my kids all can avoid the mental illness I had!
